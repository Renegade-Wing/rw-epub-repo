The Contessa looked at him intently, a wry smile spreading across her face.

“You’ve caused quite a bit of trouble here, Major,” she said. “But I know just what you need.”

He felt himself being lifted simultaneously by her pair of hands and the tentacled appendages protruding from her back. As the appendages curled around his body, he felt them change from a firm grasp to one where he was being squeezed to the point of not being able to breathe. Where her appendages touched his skin, he could feel the softy, velvety suckers grasping his skin. Sitting upright, staring her in the eyes, uncertain of what she was about to do next, it almost felt as if he was having the breath squeezed out of him.

“This,” he half-gasped, “isn’t really necessary.”

The Contessa’s eyes glinted, like a creature about to make the final move against its prey. She gave a low, throaty laugh of amusement.

“Oh, but it is, Major,” she said, constricting her grip a bit more.

He tried to take a gasp of air, but had difficulty doing so.

“Now,” she said, gently pursing her lips, “it’s time to get the reward you deserve.”
