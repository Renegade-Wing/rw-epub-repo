Chapter 1
:::

Sweat streamed down Korwin Solari’s face as he neared the final stages of his morning exercise routine. His numerous business dealings weighed considerable stress throughout many of his days, and he enjoyed keeping fit so that he could keep his mind and body focused.

“Just two more, sir,” chimed his fitness droid, who was looking down at him while he pushed the dumbbell weights upwards.

“Two,” exhaled Korwin. “And … one….”

“Another excellent workout, sir,” said the droid as it took the dumbbell from him and set it back on the bench press holdings.

“Thank you, Kay-Four,” said Korwin as he wiped the sweat from his face with a towel, then wrapped it around the back of his neck. “I’ll be in my private chambers. Hold any calls that come in.”

“Yes, sir.”

Korwin walked across the length of his private gym, entering a door on the far right of the room. This led to his private office, which was spartan in design save for his immaculately clean mahogany work desk, a cabinet built into the wall of the left side of the room that contained prestigious awards and priceless artifacts from a dozen worlds, and a large painting of his family that was squarely placed on the crimson wall to his right.

He stopped to look at it, as he did every morning. To remind him of his heritage. The sacrifices made.

Of loved ones lost.

The breeze and sound of the waves gently cascaded through the windows that overlooked the beach and ocean below his villa. The soft glow of orange light from the newly rising sun lit the darkened room just enough so he could move about.

The painting portrayed his Pantoran mother and father, both prominent figures on Eudora. His father, stern but composed in his white and black business suit, a red carnation rose nestled in his lapel pocket. His father’s hand rested on the shoulder of a much younger version of Korwin from his childhood days, who was dressed in his boarding school uniform. His mother was portrayed sitting down, her features soft and beautiful. Her wavy, lilac-colored hair spilled down naturally, complimenting her flowing, cream-colored maxi dress. In her arms was his younger sister in a peach-coloured dress, still but a few years old then.

He could hear in the back of his mind the mantra that his father had instilled in him on an almost daily basis when he was growing up.

_A Solari must always do what needs to be done. No matter the cost. Employ this lesson, my son, and no enemy will ever challenge you._

_His mother, despite her beauty and warmth, had also been of a similar mind to his father, and her words washed across his memories of her as well._

_A Solari never wavers from their commitments, my dear boy. There is no doubt, no apprehension. Only success. A Solari must always be successful._

But they were both gone now. His father’s firm hand but a shadow on his shoulder. His mother’s warm hands but a memory. His dear sister’s body was never found after the accident. And despite their untimely deaths many years ago, he took their words to heart. It had allowed him to remain strong. Focused. Disciplined. Successful in his business dealings. And, most importantly, unopposed. All except, of course, one matter that had eluded him these past few years.

He was about to move towards the entryway to his private bathing room when the communicator on his desk chimed. Taking a few steps forward, he pressed the button on the console.

“Kay-Four, I thought I told you to hold my calls.”

“It’s Ceryss, sir,” came the soft voice of his personal assistant. “I’m sorry to disturb you, but a rather urgent call has come in.”

“Can’t it wait?” he asked, annoyed.

“I don’t think so, sir. It’s an encrypted message. From your mutual benefactor.”

Korwin exhaled slowly.

“I see. Thank you, Ceryss. Transfer it to my private chamber.”

“Very well, sir. Transferring it through now.”

The roar of the waves crashing against the sand intensified, as did the breeze whipping in through the windows. As he pressed another button on the console, the figure of a smartly-dressed female Imperial officer came into view. Her intent and calculating eyes met his.

“Captain Gaspra,” he said coolly. “To what do I owe this pleasure?”

“Shore leave,” said First Lieutenant Nick “Jasted” Finelli as the group of pilots crossed the hangar bay towards the awaiting transports. “It’s about kriffing time!”

“A few days of rest, relaxation, and girls,” piped up another pilot. “Girls as far as the eye can see!”

The look on Lieutenant Gemilan’s face gave away some displeasure at the pilot’s comments. Taking a free hand, she gave the pilot next to her a quick slap. “Is that all you stick-jockeys can think about?”

The pilot was caught off guard and gave a quick yelp. “Hey, relax Lieutenant,” he said with a smirk. “Yours truly is a natural babe magnet. One look at me, and the fine ladies will be over me like bees on a --.”

As Gemilan gave a huff of disgust and increased her pace, several nearby pilots laughed. “Men,” she said with a disgruntled voice.

“All right, guys, settle down,” said Andrew “Dobber” Dobson as he turned to walk backwards and face the group. “I’m sure there will be a little something for everyone. Just don’t party too hard.”

“Says you, Major!” piped up someone from the back.

As he was about to reply he felt himself bump into someone from behind. The group of pilots stopped as well. Turning around, he saw that it was Lieutenant Colonel Chris “Jalb_k” Reynolds, the current leader of Rogue Squadron.

Oh kriff, thought Dobson.

A small smile spread across Reynolds’ face as he stepped in beside him.

“Better watch where you’re going, Major,” he said, placing an arm around him. “And I’m sure you could use some time to unwind and be your unusual self. Especially,” he said after a moment, “if you intend to get any snuggling done.”

The group of pilots broke into a roar of laughter. It had been no secret by this point that he had been unintentionally caught in his own quarters with his then Executive Officer of Blue Squadron the night before the Battle of Endor. While they had both survived the major battle, it resulted in them being reassigned to different units. She had been assigned to General Syndulla’s group as they required someone with experience, though she had simultaneously been demoted. He, on the other hand, had kept his rank and been transferred to be the Executive Officer of Buccaneer Squadron while Blue Squadron was officially disbanded due to casualties and general re-organization.

“Cheer up, mate,” continued Reynolds, removing his arm and giving him a slight punch in the left shoulder. “Just having a laugh. Enjoy your time down with Dia.”

“Thanks,” replied Andrew, his face turning a slight shade of red from embarrassment.

“What about you, Lieutenant Colonel? Where will you be heading?” someone else asked.

“Honestly,” said Reynolds, “time away from you group of hairy Wookiees will be a vacation enough.”

Laughter erupted from a few pilots.

“Truth be told though,” he continued with a chuckle, “I’ll be part of the second wave taking shore leave. Someone’s gotta protect your sorry butts while you’re down there getting stung by all the queen bees,” he finished with a wink.

Andrew was fairly certain he saw Gemilan roll her eyes in disgust.

Just then a deck officer walked up to the growing group of pilots and other personnel in the area.

“Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen,” he began. “Those of you going down to Baterron will be in Group A. You’ll be taking the lambda-class shuttle to your right. Those of you going to the resort moon Eudora will be in Group B. You’ll be taking the lambda-class shuttle to your left. Make sure you have everything you need. Once you are down there, you won’t be coming back for a few days.” A chorus of cheers rose from the crowd at this last sentence. A few pilots and personnel gave fist-pumps in the air at this news as the deck officer continued speaking. “One final thing: the return shuttles will only be making one trip back for your particular group. Do not be late for the cut-off time. Otherwise, enjoy your shore leave.”

With that, the group dispersed and headed towards their respective shuttles. There were far more personnel heading towards the shuttle for the main planet. Only a handful of pilots and personnel made their way with Dobson towards the second shuttle.

As they boarded the loading ramp and took their seats, Andrew thought back to the private correspondence he received from Dia the week before.

_Andrew,_

_I know it’s short notice, but I’ve taken care of all the arrangements. Don’t worry about a thing! Meet me at the Marivaal Resort. Give your name at the front desk._

_See you soon,_

_Dia_

_P.S. – Bring **plenty** of credits._

They’d been trying to coordinate leave time together, but with the way that things were moving with the transition from the Alliance to the New Republic these days, sometimes things seemed more chaotic than before Endor.

He didn’t know how it happened, but it was pure luck that they’d been able to coordinate this time together after being apart for so long. He wasn’t too keen on her emphasis of bringing credits, if only because he wasn’t looking forward to any shopping sprees that drained his meager bank account.

_Still_, he thought as he strapped himself in, _she is worth every credit._ He just hoped that he wouldn’t be broke by the end of the mini-vacation.

:::

As the shuttle ramp descended on the landing pad thirty-five minutes later, the group of pilots and personnel walked down into what could only be described as paradise. Lush green trees and shrubbery decorated the view in front of them, as did more than a dozen varieties of beautiful and colourful flowers. The warm sun beamed down on the newly arrived group, and a cool breeze came in off the water. In the distance he could see white foamy waves gradually crashing then receding against the white sand of the beach, which was dotted by patrons and vacationers. Children scurried to and fro, chasing each other or running back from the waves, then into them as they came in. Further off, he could see sailing ships interspersed along the seascape in the distance.

They were met by a bronze 3P0-style protocol droid once the group was unloaded.

“Greetings,” said the droid in a female voice as it took slow steps towards them. “I am Tee-Kay-Four-Bee. I’d like to welcome you to our humble resort of Marivaal. Please follow me as I take you to our check-in facility. From there, you will be guided to your rooms.”

The droid turned and began to lead the group down the curving path of smooth white stones that led into a cluster of trees and other bushes. As they rounded the corner, he could begin to see the colors and shapes of the buildings coming into focus.

_By the Force_, he thought in amazement when they cleared the entrance path, _**this** is humble?!_

Beings from dozens of worlds milled about the area. And not just any beings. Beings who had money that could easily afford to flaunt their status and wealth while on vacation – and look casual while doing so.

In the center of the courtyard stood what could only be described as two fish-type creatures pouring water into a crystal clear fountain pool. Numerous white-stoned buildings were decorated beautifully with orange rust-colour terracotta tiles arranged neatly along the slanted tops and edges. Every building had siding that contained geometric patterns to resemble exotic shapes and creatures, and some of the more prominent buildings had white marble and gold figures lining the entry or archways, almost as if to depict a scene from a story.

And that was just the beginning.

As he looked around, he could see shops that advertised luxurious goods from possibly a hundred worlds. Marble statues were placed every so often near sitting areas or some of the street pathways, paying tribute to several figures from a variety of races and genders. He also noticed some tented sections where merchants sold their goods and wares – and not the inexpensive, trinket types either. There must have been stalls with two dozen or more ripe and luscious fruits alone, not to mention exotic flowers or seashell jewelry. Some of the larger seashells glinted as the sunlight hit them, indicating that they were encrusted with precious stones and gems.

“As you will see,” said the protocol droid, turning to the crowd and extending an arm, “there are different colored bricks that line the ground. Each one will lead you to a specific location or district. A map will be provided to you upon check-in. Please follow the yellow bricks and enjoy your stay.”

Andrew stared for a few extra seconds at the yellow bricks, which were in fact a rich gold-color, that were placed along the white-stoned court. He could not help himself but wonder if they were really made of gold or painted to resemble the color. As the group began to make their way past him, he followed the yellow bricks until he came to an open-aired building that had an aquamarine banner which read _REGISTRATION_ in distinct white lettering. He immediately noticed a flower merchant adjacent to the registration area with a dozen different types and colours of flowers he did not recognize. Briskly making his way over to it, he saw the male owner fixing up the display while another employee was pruning flowers in a bouquet behind him.

“Good afternoon, sir,” said the dark-skinned owner with a thick but cheerful accent as Andrew stopped at the stall. “How may I be of service to you today?”

“I am in need of flowers,” he said, his eyes darting around the display.

“Ah! That is something I can most definitely help you with. May I ask the occasion?”

“Let’s just say it’s for someone very special whom I have not seen for a long time. What would you recommend?”

The owner flashed him a smile and clasped his hands together.

“Ah, to be sure that I understand you correctly, sir, is this special someone a close family member or friend? Or a lover perhaps?”

Andrew’s face turned a slight shade of red at the embarrassment from the question.

“Let’s just say more than a friend....”

“Oh ho!” he said in delight, placing one hand on the table in front of him and raising a pointed finger in the air. “Hakeem knows exactly how to help a man such as yourself who is in love, sir! So that I may help you make the best selection, can you tell me about her? What is her personality?”

He was caught off guard by the last set of questions.

“Uh, how does that matter?” he asked.

“Certainly you yourself would understand, sir,” Hakeem said, leaning forward and speaking to him intently, “the value of picking the right gift for the right partner. Especially if you have been apart for some time.”

Can’t argue there, Andrew thought. “Okay then. She’s … headstrong. Strong-willed. Loyal. Dependable. Assertive, but caring. She can be funny. And…”

“Beautiful?” Hakeem cut in, raising an eyebrow.

“More beautiful than any sunrise or sunset,” he finished.

Hakeem stood back and clasped his hands together. “She sounds like a woman of determination and true beauty, my good sir. And Hakeem has just the solution for you! These,” he said, gesturing to the left of the table, “are two varieties of Kinkorrian Lillies.” Andrew noticed their curving, oval-shaped petals extending outwards with several yellow stamens protruding from the centre of each. “The red ones symbolize passion and determination, while the white ones symbolize purity and love. A fine combination for your lady, I believe.”

“That sounds like a good combination. How much for a bouquet?”

“A bouquet of these beautiful flowers would normally be three-hundred credits,” Hakeem began.

“_Three-hundred credits!_” Andrew choked out.

“Yes, sir,” continued Hakeem without missing a beat. “Such beautiful flowers are difficult and time-consuming to cultivate. But luckily for you, they are in season and freshly picked. For a lucky man such as yourself, Hakeem would be willing to sell them to you for, say … two-hundred credits.”

“One-fifty,” Andrew countered after a few seconds, guessing that Hakeem was someone in the business of haggling.

“I’m afraid one-fifty is not a good price for a full bouquet, sir. Several flowers, maybe.”

“One-seventy-five,” Andrew countered.

“Hakeem must also pay his employees, who work very hard. He would be willing to do, say, one-ninety credits.”

“One-eighty-five,” Dobson countered once more, growing more impatient with Hakeem. “And not a credit more.”

Hakeem paused for a moment, a serious look on his face. “One-eighty-five,” he said, before breaking into a jubilant laugh and pointing at Andrew, “is a price that Hakeem can live with to please his customers! And you have made a very _excellent choice_, sir. I’ll prepare it right away!”

Not happy about the price that he was paying for the flowers, Andrew paid Hakeem and held the bouquet in his hands shortly thereafter.

_Still_, he thought as he walked back towards the registration area, _she is worth it._

Walking up to one of the kiosk lines, he waited while those ahead of him registered with the staff and droids. When it was his turn, he was greeted by a yellow-skinned female Rodian.

“Good afternoon, sir,” she said, keying up her computer. “Name please?”

“Andrew Dobson,” he said as he placed his duffle bag on the ground next to him.

“Dobson … Dobson… ah! Here we go. We already have you booked to stay with Miss Dia Tann. You’ll be staying at one of the guest apartments of the Villa de Sanquo.”

“Villa?” he asked, blinking.

“Yes, sir,” she continued, “the Villa apartments are reserved for our esteemed guests throughout the year for special occasions.”

“I see,” he said slowly as she handed him a map of the area.

“This map contains a layout of the shops and districts in the area, as well as local and emergency contact information. Let me finish up here and I’ll have a serving droid take your bags for you.”

As she made the final few keystrokes, a laminated card with the unit name and number appeared from a small machine to her right. Placing it in a burgundy card envelope with the resort’s logo on it, she handed it to him.

“Bixby will take your bag and show you to your room.”

Pressing a button on her console, a droid emerged from the room behind her. Only it wasn’t any droid. It was a Clone Wars era B-1 battle droid! It must have been one that had been bought after market and reprogrammed from a killing machine into a serving machine.

“Bixby,” she said to the droid as it moved around the counter. “This is Mr. Dobson. He will be staying at Guest Apartment One of the Villa de Sanquo. Please take his bag and see him there.”

“Of course, madame,” said the droid with its slightly comical, buzzing voice. As the droid picked up his bag, he followed it down the corridor past two security officers to the right and into a larger courtyard. The courtyard had several small vehicle transports with R2 driving units placed in them. Both the droids and the transports looked as if they were in pristine condition.

Bixby did not move towards any of these, however, and continued walking down the stone path bordered by trees lush with leaves and a variety of orange and yellow fruits, not to mention white blossoms. After walking for several minutes they arrived at their destination.

_This isn’t an apartment, he thought as he took in the building in front of him. It’s a small house!_

As he glanced down the road, he could see a handful of others that were similar every few dozen feet or so.

The building was, like the others in the region, ornate with its design and layout. It had a small wooden gate that needed to be opened to enter the premises. Several windows of varying sizes were laid neatly on either side of the building’s main door and archway, hinting at the rooms within the building. The roof was slanted and contained water funnels to allow for drainage when it rained. There was also a small yard with neatly-cut grass on either side of the stone walkway that led up to the door. He also took notice of the flower beds nestled against the side of the house. Staring at the flowers planted in them, he looked at the bouquet in his hand, then back to the house again. They were the same Kinkorrian lily varieties that he had bought at the merchant’s kiosk.

_Well … kriff,_ he thought.

The building was similar in quality to the buildings he had seen earlier. Yet somehow, it seemed more relaxed and quainter. Perhaps it was because of the lack of other conjoined buildings and the bustling crowd.

Opening the gate, the droid led him to the door. It was a thick and heavy door which had an ornate metal handle on the right. The door also had what must have been a symbol or crest of some sort carved into it. To the right of the door was a small black panel that could be used to insert an ID card.

“Here you are, sir,” said the droid. “Would you like me to take your bag inside for you?”

“That’s okay, Bixby,” Andrew replied as he took the bag from the droid. “I’ll take it inside myself.”

“Very well. If you need anything, sir, please do not hesitate to call the resort. There is a comm unit inside should you need any type of service.”

“Thank you, Bixby. I’ll be sure to call if I need anything.”

“Roger, roger,” replied Bixby as the droid turned around and walked back the way they had come. Andrew could only stare at the droid and shake his head at the droid’s reply. Taking out his card, he swiped it through the black box. Hearing a click, he used the hand the card was in to open the door and step inside.

The door opened into a fair-sized entryway with checkered marble tiles of cream white and crystal blue. There was a small entryway for removing footwear and hanging up coats, and a medium-sized half-circular table with an adjoining mirror attached to it. Moving further in, he entered an open-concept living room that had cream carpeting, a main sofa, and several pieces of furniture surrounding a small coffee table. He noticed the windows had thick curtains tied to the sides, and the odd piece of artwork that fit comfortably with the style and taste of the room.

This was immediately followed by a sizable kitchen area that also had a marble flooring, as well as a main cooking unit with refrigeration and storage units along with a cleaning sink. The odd plant was placed along the counters as well, more so as decorative pieces. To his right was a small entryway that had what appeared to be a hidden but curved stairwell that led upstairs to the other rooms. Ahead and next to the kitchen was a sliding double-glass door that led to what he thought was a deck outside. A translucent white curtain was fluttering in the wind, indicating that the door was partially open.

“Dia?” he called after taking stock of everything.

“I’m out here!” he heard her faintly call.

Placing his duffel bag down on the floor, he walked forward to the glass doorway while placing the bouquet of flowers behind his back. Moving the curtain aside, he opened the door enough to exit and walked out onto the deck, which was large enough to host numerous guests for entertainment or a barbeque party. What he saw was pure beauty – and he did not mean just the property and sandy-white beachfront he viewed.

There stood Dia, leaning against the edge of the deck. Her blue skin glistened with suntan lotion as the sun’s gentle rays and warmth fell on her. As she turned around, he saw that she was holding a long glass with a pink-coloured drink in it, which also contained a red straw, a small paper umbrella, and a slice of an orange fruit. Her beachwear was a slightly revealing but still modestly appropriate orange ruffled swimwear top. She also wore what he thought was a high waist bikini that was mostly covered by a flowing orange, red, and white cover-up piece that partially exposed one of her blue legs and bare feet.

“Hello, handsome,” she said with a smile and began walking towards him, “long time no see.”

“I’m sorry,” he said, shaking his head. “I must have the wrong address. I’m looking for my girlfriend, Dia Tann. Perhaps an angel such as yourself could point me in the right direction?”

She smiled and gave out a slight giggle as she set her drink down on a small table to her left. As he neared her, she moved her arms to wrap them around his waist, he likewise doing something similar with his left arm. Their bodies embraced, and they began exchanging several kisses.

“Seriously,” he tried to say in between the kisses, “if she knew I was kissing another gorgeous woman, she’d probably kill me. I really need to find her.”

“Damn straight I would,” she said with a grin before kissing him one final time.

“And these,” he said, moving the flowers from behind his back, “are for you.”

“Kinkorrian lilies!” she exclaimed, smelling them deeply. “You are too sweet! You do know that these are also in the flower beds out front, right?” she asked, raising an eyebrow.

“Some things I learn the hard way,” he said with a sigh.

She kissed him one final time before taking her right hand and pressing it against his cheek, stroking it with her thumb. “I missed you.”

“And I, you,” he said, taking her hand in his and kissing it. “But I have one question.”

“Oh?”

“How did you afford such a luxurious place?! I’m fairly certain we’re not being bankrolled. Well, at least I’m not anyway.”

“I told you in my message, don’t worry about it. I have everything taken care of.”

“Okay,” he said, bringing her hand down and squeezing it. “I just hope I don’t go bankrupt while we’re here.”

“You won’t,” she laughed, “unless you decide to spend it all in one place. Or go to the casino. Which you shouldn’t,” she said, pointing a finger at his nose.

“Don’t worry,” he said with a grin. “I’m not that inept.”

“Says you,” she said with a playful smirk, lowering her finger.

“So. We have a few days to ourselves. What should we do?”

“Well, the first thing you’re going to do is take this bottle of sunscreen and apply a fresh coat to my back and legs while I soak up some more sun.”

“This sounds like a great start to our vacation,” he said with a wink.

Gently tapping him in the chest with her free hand, she reached for the bottle of lotion and handed it to him while placing the bouquet of flowers on the table. Squirting some lotion into his hands, she turned around and he began applying it to her shoulders and back.

“While I’m doing that, you’re going to go upstairs and have a shower. You smell of sweat and motor oil. And your clothes are a bit … inappropriate for this setting.”

“Hey, it didn’t help that our old command ship got blown up by the Second Death Star. My one good shirt was on that ship,” he said as he applied lotion to her back.

“I also went ahead and bought you a brand new shirt and shorts, and some other dressware. They’re waiting for you in the bedroom.”

“Did you at least pick something that matches the colour of my eyes?” he asked playfully.

“Ha. I picked something that is tasteful and matches my new outfit.” She turned around and opened her palms, indicating that she would do her arms, front, and face herself. Squirting some lotion into her palms, she did just that. “Then after that, we’ll go back into town. I’ll show you around, do some shopping. Dinner at six, fireworks along the beach later at night, which we can also watch here.”

“How many bedrooms does this place have, anyway?”

“A few. You can pick any that you like, though I’d recommend the one at the far right when you go upstairs. Allows for a nice breeze if you have the window open at night. Or,” she said with a slight pause, “if you’re feeling comfortable with the idea, we could both share the master bedroom.”

He paused for a moment and thought about this as she finished applying lotion to herself. He certainly didn’t want to seem chauvinistic, or too forward given what had happened before Endor. Still, they had been together for some time. Maybe it was time to take the next step.

“Well,” he said, carefully thinking about his response, “I’m open to negotiations.”

“Good,” she said after a moment, seemingly happy with the response. “You just forgot one thing.”

“What’s that?”

Moving her hand to her waist, she undid the beach skirt and tossed it gently away, revealing her blue legs.

“Don’t forget to do the legs. And the lekku.” Taking her drink once more, she turned and walked over to the long deck chair in the middle of the deck. Laying down on it, she spread one leg out while propping the other up with her foot.

“Yes ma’am!” he replied as she put on a pair of sunglasses, then took a sip from her drink.

“I love a man who listens,” she said with a grin as he walked over and put some lotion into his hands.
