Chapter 3
:::

They took their time while walking and entered the bustling shopping district hand in hand about fifteen minutes later. They each had a fruit kebab in their offhand, having stopped at a small vendor kiosk in the main square to buy some. They were, he thought at the time, a bit overpriced. Then again, he couldn’t argue about the delicious taste.

As they followed the purple bricks and moved deeper into the shopping district, he couldn’t help but notice the number of droids and servants for some of the female patrons carrying stacks of boxes in their hands with multiple bags hanging off of each arm.

“They must be loaded,” he murmured to her as they made their way past several pairs of patrons and shops.

“Some of them are,” she said, glancing at him. “This is a district which is extremely popular with the wealthier patrons who visit the resort. But, there are a few shops around here that offer more affordable options and products,” she finished, taking another bite out of her kabab.

“And I suppose you’ve already done some scouting as to which shops you want to go to?” he asked.

She gave him another quick glance, a small smile creasing her lips. “You could say that. Let’s stop here first,” she gestured towards a clothing store on their right.

Its title was Veronique’s. Mannequins lined the large windows displaying a variety of beach and dresswear. A holographic signed near the entrance boldly displayed that a sale was going on. 40% OFF! TODAY ONLY! it read.

“Well, I guess a shop or two wouldn’t hurt,” he said, stopping with her to let some patrons exit. “By the way, where’s Bee-Dee-Bee-Two? I haven’t seen him since I got –.”

As if on cue, he felt something small and heavy grab onto his short legs and begin its climb up his torso. The droid settled on his right shoulder, giving a few chirps as he turned to look at the little droid. Then it began to purr.

“… here,” he finished. “Hi, Bee-Two. Have you been following us this whole time?”

The droid chirped an affirmation at Andrew’s inquiry.

“He’s missed you.”

“Oh really? I haven’t seen the little rust bucket since – ow!” he exclaimed as the droid lifted its left foot and jabbed him in the side of the face. “Why you little!--”

“Okay, you two, be nice,” interjected Dia, lifting her arm to let Bee-Dee climb onto her. The little droid gave an annoyed grunt and moved onto her shoulder. “We are on vacation after all.”

Andrew and the droid eyed one another for a few seconds before he extended his arm to offer a handshake with the droid. “Okay, Bee-Dee. I’ll be good to you if you’ll be good to me. Shake on it?” The little droid eyed his hand for another few seconds, considering the offer. Then it extended its left foot again and placed it in his hand, while giving a sound that was the closest thing to a droid saying ‘deal’.

“Now that that’s taken care of,” Dia said as she rubbed her hands together, “let’s get to shopping!”

Three hours later, Andrew sat bored in a comfortable chair in the area between the clothing and perfume section of their fifth store that afternoon. A small pile of bags from the other stores were near him.

“Dia,” he drawled, slumped against one of the arms of the chair, his fist propping up his left cheek, “how many more stores are you planning on visiting? At this rate, you might have to get your own private transport just to ship everything back to you.” BD-B2 was keeping himself entertained by skipping and hopping from one clothing rack to another, humming and chirping a simple tune.

“This is the last one, I promise,” she said, rifling through a circular rack with dresses. She pulled two out and held them up in front of her. “Which do you think is better? The magenta or the purple one?”

“Aren’t they the same thing?”

Raising an eyebrow, she gave him a slightly annoyed look.

“Okay, okay!” he said, sitting up and raising his palms. “Why don’t you take the ones you’ve found and try them on? See which ones look the best. And,” he said under his breath, “hope they don’t break the bank.”

“It’s three for the price of one!” she exclaimed. “When will there ever be a deal like this again?”

“Probably when I get my next paycheck,” he replied, slightly annoyed.

”Oh, ha-ha,” she retorted. Taking several of the dresses she had already picked out, she made her way to the dressing room area where he could see other patrons being waited on by store staff. “I’ll be back.”

Tired of sitting around, he got up and began meandering through the store, casually looking at the items in stock and making his way around other customers. He could hear BD-B2 following him, jumping from rack to rack, still humming his little tune. Eventually, he made his way back to the perfume and cologne section of the store, the strong scents begging to overpower his olfactory senses immediately. Other humans and aliens were milling about the section as well, inquiring with the staff about the perfumes and colognes, or simply making their way by.

As he looked at the names and prices of the dozens of different vials and bottles on display, he couldn’t help but think about how overpriced some of them were. It made the perfume he got for Dia look cheap. He also noticed that B2 had made his way onto the counter, and was nonchalantly moving to a side counter that had samples of perfume spray bottles.

“Excuse me, sir,” said a female-style serving droid as she approached the counter. “Is there something I can help you with?”

“Oh, no thank you, I’m just looking for the time being.”

“Very well, sir. Please let us know if you need anything.”

“I will. Okay, Bee-Dee,” he said as he began to turn to the droid, “let’s go see what –.” He froze as he looked at the droid.

It had one of its metal footpads on the spray pump of a perfume bottle with its nozzle aimed squarely at his face. Before he could say another word, the droid gave a gleeful titter and pressed down on the pump. A spray of strong odorous mist flew at his face. His eyes began to burn from the chemicals.

“AHH!” he exclaimed in surprise and pain. Stumbling backwards, he almost immediately bumped into someone behind him, who let out a cry of surprise. Using one free hand to wipe at his eyes, he tried to turn and apologize, only to feel something small and metal behind his feet – which he was certain was B2 -- and he began to lose his footing. As he fell backwards, he felt something tentacle-like wrap around his torso and neck. It was strong enough to prevent him from falling any further and maintain his position.

“You poor dear,” he heard a woman’s firm voice say from in front of him. “Are you alright?”

“I can’t see,” he said, tears stinging his eyes and beginning to run down his face.

“Seela, dear, give me some water,” said the woman as she propped him up and held him in place. He heard the twisting of a cap off a water bottle and a few small splashes fall on the floor in front of him. “Here,” he heard her say as she pressed a damp cloth into his other free hand, “use this.”

Rubbing it against his face and eyes, the cool cloth began to help make the pain reside. It was almost another minute before he could see properly again, and as the figure in front of him came into focus, he couldn’t help but be taken aback by whom he saw. In front of him stood quite possibly one of the most attractive alien women he had ever seen.

Her skin was an orangey red, and her eyes were an emerald green. Her lips were full and coated in a violetta shade of lipstick. In place of hair she had a series of smooth tentacles that flowed backwards and moved slowly, almost hypnotically. She was wearing a rich burgundy dress with cut-out shoulders that made no effort to hide her curves and ample bosom. The dress must have also been partially cut out at the back. While it was clear she had the same arms and legs as any other humanoid, four thick tentacles with pinkish-white suckers flowed from behind her.

Some might have considered her unattractive for an alien species.

To him, she was _vivacious_!

As she removed one of her tentacled appendages from around him, another shot past him. Lifting it up to him, he could see B2 squirming vainly to try and get away. The droid began to let out a panicked series of beeps and chirps.

“This little one seems to be the source of all the commotion,” she said, looking carefully at the droid she had snared.

“I am so sorry, Miss?” he asked as he reached for the droid.

“Contessa Suli deChenzzi,” she said, handing the droid back to him. He quickly turned the chirping droid over and flicked a switch on the back of its head off. The light in the droid’s eyes faded, and he went limp as he was powered off.

“Thank you, Miss deChenzzi,” he said, returning the cloth to her. “Bee-Two likes to be very mischievous sometimes.”

“Bee-Dee units certainly can be. And you are?” she asked him.

“Major Andrew Dobson, attached to the _CRS Vigilant_,” he replied, handing the wet towelette back to her.

“A Major!” she exclaimed with an amused tone, gently taking it in her hand and passing it to her serving girl. Then, with a rich, sultry voice, “and what brings such a _handsome_ young man such as yourself to our fair resort?”

“Just here for some shore leave,” he replied, slightly nervous. “Our ship is undergoing a repair and resupply operation over the next few days.”

“Is that so?” she asked, shifting her stance to give herself more appeal. “Are you here by yourself?”

“No,” he said a little uncomfortably at this line of questioning. “I’m here shopping with my partner. She’s enjoying herself with today’s sale. And, coincidentally, draining my bank account at the same time,” he finished with a short laugh.

“Well, with a well-dressed man such as yourself,” the Contessa continued without missing a beat and gently brushing his shoulder, “I am sure she is worth every credit.”

“She is,” he replied.

“Major, if you’ll excuse me, I must be going. I have important business to attend to. But before I do,” she said as her Twi’lek serving girl handed her an expensive looking white purse. Reaching into it, she produced a small gold card made of plastic. “Should you ever find yourself in need of first-class service, please use this card at any location in the resort, all expenses paid. Consider it a thank-you for your services with the Alliance. I do hope you enjoy your stay.” As she passed him, he felt her tentacles brush against him deliberately. He turned to look at her and saw her glancing over her shoulder at him. “And I do so hope we meet again.”

Watching her leave, he flipped the card over, noticing it had only the name of the resort and its logo on it, save for the words ‘Executive Membership Card’ on it. Giving a shrug, and mostly glad that their flirtatious encounter was over, he returned to the area with their original bags. After another few minutes Dia returned to him with a serving droid holding the dresses that she didn’t apparently want.

“What’s wrong with your eyes?” she asked, looking at him. It was then that she noticed B2 was lifeless in his hands. “And what did you do to Bee-Dee?”

“I didn’t do anything,” he protested, holding the droid up. “This little scamp decided to spray me with some perfume in the face. Some ritzy and vivacious female patron kindly caught him and gave me some water to help with my eyes.”

Taking the droid from his hands, she switched him back on. His eyes came back to life and he looked around nervously.

“Bee-Two,” she said, looking at the droid sternly. “What did I tell you about being on your best behaviour?”

The droid began to give a series of chirps and whistles, but she cut him off.

“I don’t care what you think,” she said, lifting the droid to eye level. “Either you be good or you’ll be switched off for the rest of the trip.”

The droid gave a chirp of disgust before giving what Andrew thought was a sigh. BD-B2 swiveled his head around and gave a series of quick beeps that may have translated into an apology.

“That’s better,” she said, placing the droid on her shoulder. “Now, let’s pay for these and be on our way. I’ll have a serving droid deliver everything back to the apartment.”

_About time,_ he thought, moving with her towards the counter. When the cashier rang in the final price, his mouth fell open enough that Dia noticed.

“It’s _that_ much?!” he exclaimed.

“It could be worse, dear,” she said, taking his arm. “Especially if you were looking at a ritzy and vivacious patron. But I’m worth every credit,” she asked, turning to look at him, “right?”

Wishing he’d kept his mouth shut, he couldn’t argue with that. But at this rate, he’d be bankrupt by the end of the day. Paying the cashier, Dia gave her numerous bags to the serving droid for delivery. They exited the shop into the waning heat and light of the late afternoon sun, his wallet feeling assuredly lighter.
