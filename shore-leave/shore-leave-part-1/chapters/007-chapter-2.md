Chapter 2
:::

After taking an extra long hot shower – a luxury that was not available to anyone on the Vigilant – he found the clothes she mentioned laying on the queen-sized bed in one of the guest bedrooms. It was spartan in terms of furniture, but spacious enough that one could easily move around. She had picked out a red shirt with a pattern of various-sized white flowers covering both sides plus the short sleeves. There was also a comfortable pair of cream-coloured khaki shorts with two pockets on the side that came down just above his knees. Lastly, a new pair of footwear for walking that fit perfectly and felt like he was walking on clouds. Surveying himself in the mirror at the opposite end of the room, he thought the attire suited him well.

He then remembered the perfume gift that he had brought with him. Gremlin had promised to order him some after a mission a while back, and she had made good on her promise to do so. Reaching into his duffle bag, he pulled out a sky-blue rectangular box the size of his hand. Opening it, it contained a small vial about half the length of a pen. The box also contained what must have been a handwritten note from Gremlin. Fishing it out of the box, he opened it and read its contents.

_Dobson,_

_The perfect gift for the perfect girl._

_Don’t screw this up._

_G._

_P.S. -- Hope you get LOTS of snuggles!!_

_Mischievous as ever_ he thought as he took out the small vial of perfume. It contained a liquid that was tinted a light yellow. The label was emblazoned on the side with the company logo below it. Rosewater Mist it read. Unscrewing the black cap, he expected an overpowering scent, but instead was met with a gentle though intoxicatingly sweet smell.

_Jackpot!_ he thought as he felt himself relax from the smell. She’ll love this!

He screwed the cap back on and began to make his way downstairs. Descending the spiral staircase into the combined kitchen and living room area, he met her as she was finishing putting the flowers in a vase full of water.

“Well, what do you think?” she asked, turning towards him.

“I think you have perfect taste,” he said. “I love it.”

“Thought you would. What’s that?” she asked as she moved towards him, looking at the vial in his hand.

“This,” he said as she stopped in front of him, “is a lovely little gift for a lovely woman.” He placed the vial in her palm and watched as she turned it over to examine it more closely. Her mouth opened slightly in surprise as she realized what it was.

“Rosewater Mist? Do you have any idea how much this costs?!”

“A small fortune,” he said, “though I was able to pull a string through someone in the wing to get it on short notice. Do you like it?”

Unscrewing the cap, the sweet aroma once more filled the room.

“I love it!” she exclaimed with a grin, screwing the cap back on. “This will definitely earn you some extra points in the snuggle department. I’m going to go change quickly, then we’ll go. Sunscreen’s on the counter.”

Moving past him, he jumped and gave a quick yelp as she unexpectedly pinched his bottom. He turned half around to see her flash a grin and give him a wink as she began her ascent upstairs.

While she was changing, he took the opportunity to apply some sunscreen and inspect the kitchen more closely. The fridge and pantry were stocked with a variety of foods, snacks, and beverages, artfully arranged as if someone had decided to carefully catalogue the items after shopping for groceries. The cupboards contained an array of cooking supplies, tools, and utensils, as well as fancy beach-themed dishware.

_Talk about ritzy_ he thought after surveying the kitchen. Just then, he heard her footsteps coming down the staircase. As she entered the room again, he noticed she was wearing a pair of white-heeled sandals with a flowing beach themed bardot dress that was similar in color design to his shirt. It fit her well and was obviously designed for comfort while also not being shy about showing her curves from certain angles. It had a cut near the front left that partially exposed her right leg as she walked. The dress stopped just above her chest with small off-shoulder sleeves, exposing her neck and smooth shoulders. She also wore, surprisingly to him, a pair of cream-coloured hoop earrings, as well as a cream bandana with leaf patterns across her head. And she smelled intoxicating. He tried to not be impolite, but he couldn’t help his jaw from dropping open slightly.

“Well,” she said as she stood in the doorway. “What do you think?”

“Like I’ve just died and gone to heaven,” he replied.

Taking the small white purse in her hand she moved towards him and gave him a gentle thump on his chest with it, then used her free hand to push his chin up to close his mouth.

“Careful, lover boy,” she said with a grin. “You wouldn’t want to spend all your compliments in one place, would you?”

“Only,” he said as she took his arm in hers, “if you promise not to spend all my credits in one place.”

She gave a short but sweet laugh. “No promises on that one,” she said as they made their way for the exit.
