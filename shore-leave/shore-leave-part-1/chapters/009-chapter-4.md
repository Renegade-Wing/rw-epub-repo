Chapter 4
:::

“What do you mean it’s been declined?” asked Dia, her temper beginning to rise slightly. The concierge at the front desk of the restaurant handed her back the silver-coloured card that she had given him.

“I’m sorry, madam,” he said stiffly but politely. “But I’ve tried the card several times and it is not working.”

“Is there a company you can make a vid-call to?” Andrew asked her, placing a hand gently on her right arm. “See if the card is just malfunctioning?”

“No,” she said looking at him, her nostrils flaring slightly. “They’re usually closed after five on weekends.” She turned back to face the concierge. “What about the reservation I made?”

The concierge pressed a few buttons on his computer console, then shook his head. “I’m sorry, madam, but we have no record of the reservation being made.”

“You’re kidding me,” Dia said slowly. Placing both hands on the desk in front of her, she leaned in and spoke with a low voice, locking eyes with the man in front of her. She took a quick glance at the name tag on the front of his blazer. “I made that reservation weeks ago. Listen here, Ga’ary. Do you have any idea who I am?”

“I do, madam, and I sincerely apologize for the other agent not recording your reservation properly. But the main seating areas in the restaurant are full. Unless you have one of our Executive Memberships, you will have to wait in line with the other patrons until a table opens.”

“Wait. In line. With the others,” she said through clenched teeth. “It will be at least two hours minimum before we could even possibly sit down. I am not waiting that long. I want to speak to your manager.”

Before she could continue her verbal assault on the concierge and possibly his manager, Andrew remembered the gold card that he had been given earlier.

“Is this what you mean?” he asked the concierge, digging into his shorts pocket and handing the gold card to him. The concierge took the card and swiped it through the machine. As he read through the information on the computer screen, his eyes momentarily went wide before he recomposed himself.

“This will more than do, sir,” he said, handing the card back to Andrew. “And I most sincerely apologize for my behaviour earlier. We will have a private booth ready right away.” Turning to his right, he gestured for a young female attendant with her hair cropped closely and wearing a black-and-white server uniform with a short black tie to come towards them. “E’liza,” he said to her politely, “please see our guests to the Executive dining area, booth two by the windows.”

“Right away,” she said as she turned to face Andrew and Dia. “If you will kindly follow me, I will lead you to your seating area.”

By this time Dia’s mouth had opened slightly in awe at what had just transpired.

“How did you,” she asked as they followed E’liza, “get an Executive Membership? They’re prohibitively expensive!”

“It was a gift of sorts,” Andrew replied. They stopped in front of a wall that had a turbo lift elevator which led to what must have been an upper level. “That customer who helped me earlier gave it to me. Something about my service in the Alliance. Thankfully for you, not for my good looks.”

As the turbolift doors opened, E’liza gestured for them to enter before she stepped in herself. Once inside, she pressed a button to close the doors. The turbolift began its ascent upwards.

“Yes, well, while you are good-looking, I don’t think you’d warrant getting an Executive Membership for free. Who is even going to pay the bill off?”

“Ouch,” he said as the turbolift stopped and the doors whooshed open. The dining area must have been exclusively for wealthy patrons as there were only a dozen booths placed around the rectangular dining room. Several staff members moved deftly to serve the patrons their meals and drinks or see to their other needs.

E’liza began walking forward. “This way, if you please.”

“Let’s put it this way,” Andrew said as he and Dia walked shoulder to shoulder into the room. “I’m not going to complain about a gift, but I’m not going to abuse it either. If I for some reason must spend some extra credits to pay this off, then so be it. But I was told that any expense I use this for would be covered. Hopefully, this will only be a one-time thing.” They came to a stop at a circular booth that was designed to face outwards towards the beach and ocean. Judging by its size, it could seat six to eight people. An immaculate white tablecloth covered the table in front of the red-coloured cushioned seats.

“I’ll be back with your menus shortly,” said E’liza as they sat down in the booth. “May I get you anything to drink, first?”

“I’ll start with a Blurggfire,” said Dia.

“Just some water for me to start with,” said Andrew.

“Very well, I’ll be back shortly.” As E’liza left to get their menus and drinks, Andrew turned to Dia.

“You know, you really need to work on your social skills sometimes. If I didn’t know any better, I’d say you were about to murder poor Ga’ary back there.”

Dia eyed him coolly before replying.

“Oh, I wouldn’t have murdered him. Just taught him some proper manners without running the risk of being demoted.”

“Yeah, well, keep in mind that we’re transitioning to form the next Galactic Republic from the ashes of the Empire. I’m sure being on good behaviour would go a long way to maintaining that image.”

“A fair point,” Dia said as E’liza returned with their drinks and menus. “But I will definitely be calling customer service tomorrow.”

“One Blurggfire, and one glass of water,” she said as she placed the drinks down. She also passed them a pair of crimson-padded menus to look through. “I’ll give you a few minutes to decide your main dishes. As part of the Executive Membership program, your desserts are on the house this evening.”

As E’liza walked away, Andrew flipped open his menu and began reading through the various dishes that were presented. The price next to each of them appeared to increase almost exponentially.

“Have you ever had Thyferrian Scale Bass?” she asked him.

“I haven’t,” he said after a moment. “But I think I’m going to have a heart attack with these prices.”

By the time the sun had begun to set, they’d enjoyed their entrees and main meal. The sun’s fading rays still provided ample warmth as they beamed through the glass, while the restaurant’s cooling system prevented them from getting too uncomfortable. They had tried to avoid talking about their separate assignments but ended up circling back to the topic to share their experiences and stories.

“So, what’s it like serving under General Syndulla?” he asked, leaning back in the booth, their plates and glasses empty.

“It’s tense with the assignments at times, but I’ve learned a lot from her. She really knows what she’s doing and has taught me a few tricks to use in an X-wing. They’ve gotten me out of more scrapes than I care to remember. Did you know that she trained Captain Antilles in the early days of the Rebellion?”

“I heard something about that,” Andrew replied as a new waitress came to take away their dishes. “And considering he’s survived every major battle and encounter with the Empire to date, I think you’re in pretty good hands.”

“She also has tons of stories to tell. The ones about her encounters with Grand Admiral Thrawn are very interesting.”

“Grand Admiral?” he asked her.

“Yeah. Apparently, he was a brilliant tactician that served the Empire. Very observant and calculating. Could even use art to learn about his enemy. Was always one step ahead of the Rebels he faced, and nearly brought about their destruction on a place called Lothal.”

“So, what happened to him?”

“No one really knows. And it’s probably for the best, too. Had his TIE Defender program become fully operational, it would have been bad for the Rebellion all around.”

“Ugh, TIE Advanced are bad enough. I wouldn’t want to imagine what a Defender could do.”

“Me either,” she finished as the waitress brought a piece of chocolate cake with frosting that was big enough for two people to eat. On either side of the plate was a lump of something called ‘vanilla ice cream’ on the menu. The waitress placed the cake in front of them along with two dessert forks.

“Enjoy,” she said, moving to take care of her next set of patrons.

“This Thrawn guy kind of reminds me of this Commodore Barand we’re facing off with right now. We’ve had a few close encounters with him, and he’s handed our butts to us more than once. Very tactical. Him and one of the captains serving under him.”

“Enough about work,” Dia said, sliding closer to him. “It’s time for dessert.”

Picking up one of the dessert forks, Andrew dug out a small piece of cake and frosting from the plate and fed it to her. Dia gave a slight moan as the flavour hit her mouth.

“Oh my gosh,” she said with food still in her mouth. “This is amazing!” She did the same thing with her fork. As the chocolate cake entered his mouth, a burst of flavour exploded against his tongue.

“Oh man,” Andrew said with his mouth full of cake, “I need this recipe.”

“If you do,” Dia said, going for a second mouthful, “you’ll never have a modelling career.”

Andrew gave a quick laugh and placed his right arm around her shoulders, drawing her closer.

“Well,” he said, “taking another bite of chocolate cake, “either way, at least I’ll have one subscriber who thinks I’m handsome regardless.”

This is a chapter internal break

By the time they had returned to the apartment the sun had set, and a cool breeze was coming in from the water. They found the bags of clothing from earlier in the day waiting in the living room but ignored doing anything with them for the time being. It had been a long day, and after everything they had done, they did not feel like doing much else. It was during a quick trip to the main bathroom to brush their teeth that Dia noticed the red mark on his neck.

“What’s that?” she asked, pulling his collar away slightly.

“What’s what?”

“The red mark on your neck.”

Looking at himself in the mirror, he saw what she meant. A part of his neck was red, and it appeared as if a rash or infection was slowly spreading.

“It looks like a hickey or something.”

“News to me,” he said, looking at it more closely. There were no puncture wounds, so he didn’t have to worry about an infection. “Possibly from something in the clothing or food?” he asked.

“If it was the clothing, it’d be more widespread. There might have been something in the food, but you don’t have any allergies, do you?”

“Not that I’m aware of. It’s probably nothing.”

Dia wanted to press the matter further, to ask if he had been involved with someone else recently but decided not to. It’s a silly thought, she told herself. It was unlikely that he’d have time to see someone else given how busy his squadron activities had been. Then again, they had been apart for a few months after Endor. Anything could have happened between then and now. No, she continued her train of thought. _He wouldn’t, not after the flowers and perfumes. And yet, he does have the Executive Membership card…_

“If it doesn’t clear up by morning, we can check in with the resort physician staff.”

“Sounds like a plan,” she said, giving him a weak smile.

It didn’t take them long to get ready for the fireworks that evening. They made their way to an area of the property with a hammock strung up between two tropical trees. Climbing into it, Dia had B2 activate a heating lamp that kept them from being too cold before ordering him back to the apartment to recharge for the night. The breeze from the ocean gently rocked them back and forth, and complemented the crashing waves along the beach. A few lights dotted the landscape and houses behind them, but the light was faint enough to not obscure or ruin the mood. Above them, the stars of the galaxy shone down, and they could make out several constellations that were native to the moon’s position in space.

“It’s beautiful, isn’t it,” she asked after a few minutes of silence.

“Sure is,” he said. Then after a few seconds he turned to her and said, “but only because you’re here.”

If he didn’t know any better, he swore that he saw her cheeks glowing a hot red from blushing. Shifting her position slightly, she gave him a quick peck on his cheek, then placed her head on his shoulders and her right arm across his chest.

“So,” he continued, looking at her. “What’s on the agenda for tomorrow?”

“Tomorrow will be a beach day,” she said as the hammock continued to gently rock them back and forth. “I’ve booked a snorkeling session for the morning, and we can enjoy the beachfront here for the rest of the day. Then we’ll be going on a three-day cruise.”

“A cruise?” he asked, slightly surprised.

“Yeah. See that ship out in the middle of the bay?” she said, pointing towards a massive sea cruiser off in the distance. The small lights that dotted along its hull revealed numerous decks that must have been able to hold several hundred persons.

“_That_ massive thing?” he asked. “It’s almost as large as a small Mon Calamari cruiser!”

“It is. We’ll get to spend some time seeing other areas around the continent, plus participate in events and see some shows on the cruise. There’s also the matter of the Contessa’s Thunderbolt Cup.”

“What’s that?”

“An air race that takes place during this time of year. Contestants participate in an air race and series of trials. I’ve already registered our names to take place in the event.”

“I thought the whole point of this vacation was to take a break from flying?” he asked, slightly annoyed.

“Mostly, yes,” she said with a yawn. “But the main prize is ten-thousand credits.”

He stared at her for a moment. _“Ten-thousand?”_

“Yup.”

“You really do plan everything. Will we be back in time for the shuttles to take us back?”

“Only the best,” she replied, “and yes.”

“Okay. So, you’ll have to spill the beans. How in the galaxy are you affording all of this?”

“It helps when you have a family connection. My aunt is a bit of a big deal around here, so she can help with things. Like the apartment.”

Small groups of individuals began to gather on the beach ahead of them, and those who were renting the other apartments had come out to watch the show as well.

“So, she owns the apartment we’re staying in?”

Dia looked up at him. “She owns all of them. And the resort.”

“The resort, too?!” he asked exasperatedly, looking down at her.

“Uh huh. When we get back from the cruise, we’re going to meet her for a few hours. I haven’t seen her in years, and she’d love to meet you.”

“I’ll be sure to leave a good impression, then, in case we ever want to return here.”

“I thought you would.”

They met each other’s eyes, and joined in a final kiss. It was warm and gentle, and he could still make out the faint intoxicating smell of the perfume that she had put on earlier. As they did so, they heard a whistling sound off in the distance as a small yellow streak arced up into the sky. They broke their communion to follow it. A few seconds later, it exploded into a shower of brightly-coloured yellow and white sparks. More fireworks and colours rose one after another until the sky was lit with multiple explosions at the same time. Some even took the shapes of different creatures or banners as they lit up the night sky. They could easily make out the ‘oohs’ and ‘aahs’ of those around them who were impressed with the show.

As the fireworks show wound down, the breeze from the water continued to gently rock them back and forth, and the heating lamp continued to shine warming rays over them. Her eyes were closed, and her breathing was soft and regular, indicating that she had fallen asleep against him. Not wanting to disturb her quite yet, Andrew felt her warm body against his and could only admire how beautiful she looked as the colours illuminated and danced off her blue skin. And as the resort patrons and beachgoers began their trek back to their lodgings, only the stars remained to bear witness to their love.

For the first time in as long as he could remember, after all the restless nights, battles, and pain that he had experienced in their fight against the Empire, he was at peace and happy.

He wouldn’t have traded this moment for anything. Or anyone.
