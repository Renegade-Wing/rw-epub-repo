Chapter 5
:::
 	
The sailing skiff came to a gradual halt as the skipper gave the order to cut the engines.  As the hum died down, the gungan diving instructor stood up to address the small group of beings that had registered for the scuba diving session.  The instructions were straightforward enough, and those who were not naturally inclined to have respiratory systems that allowed them to swim underwater were given breathing apparatuses.  As Andrew and Dia inserted theirs, the gungan gave a final few pointers as to their journey.
 	
“Wesa be diving down and taking the Coral Route todaysa. Thesa waters are heated by warm currents and thermal vents.  Theysa make for nice feeding and breeding grounds for muoy life forms.  Yousa need to be mindful of any sea creatures and reefs we seeya.  Theysa not so dangerous, but are protected by big bombad laws.  Our dive will takes us a through a few different areas before wesa return to the skiffsa.  If yousa run into trouble, pressa the red button on yousa diving suits and mesa come right away.  After yousa!”
 	
With that, the gungan gestured for the patrons to enter the water.
 	
“Have you ever taken this route before?” Andrew asked, taking the breathing apparatus out of his mouth.
 	
“Not this one,” Dia said, removing hers. “But I’ve done others when I was younger.  If you can pick the right one at the right time of year, it can be an experience you never forget.”
 	
“I’ll keep that in mind,” said Andrew as he reinserted the mouthpiece.  Taking her hand, they walked over to the jump-off point and both leapt into the water a few seconds after the couple in front of them did and had been able to move away.
 	
The shock of the water was initially cold, though not as cold as he thought it would be.  It wasn’t long once they had both begun pumping their arms and legs before they felt warmer.  
 	
As the group made their way forward, the gungan moved deftly through the water ahead of them.  Beams of light from the sun lit up the water ahead of them.  The water above them glittered as it moved, and below them the white sand gave way to clusters of seaweed and other marine life and features.  It wasn’t long before they encountered schools of fish and other sea creatures.
 	
The fish were of various shapes, sizes, and colours, each school moving in unison while other fish swam about individually, their gills and fins working together like clockwork.  In a nearby school, some were a mix of black and yellow colors, while others had wide, fan-like pectoral and dorsal fins.  
 	
Two sea-turtles swam over to inspect the swimmers cautiously, and passed in front of Andrew and Dia before moving off to search for food.  Their fins propelled them forward, while the design of their ovular shells glistened like a rainbow as their bodies moved through the sunny water. 
 	
Moving deeper, the group soon came to the beginnings of a reef.  Looking down, there were more creatures and colors than anyone would be able to count.  Fish and lobsters moved about the reef. Colorful seahorses swam or used their tails to anchor themselves on the coral or nearby seaweed.  A pair of crabs circled about on the seafloor, one claw held out in front with another high up in the air, clearly in a dispute about who should claim this territory. Several different types of starfish lay on rocks or pockets of sand, clearly enjoying themselves.
 	
Motioning in a direction to their right, Dia pointed at a spot in the reef where a small dark hole was nestled amongst some rocks, coral, and sea anemones.  It took a moment before he saw what she saw.  Eight long, bright-red tentacles with luminous blue suckers slowly emerged from the hole, and an octopus slowly emerged from what could only be its home.  It wasn’t long before the octopus took note of the two crabs still fighting.  Moving slowly, its tentacles guiding its path along the coral and seafloor, it approached the two opponents.   
 	
Suddenly, it shot forward.  The eight tentacles opened, causing the octopus to take the shape of an umbrella under water.  Then, it shot straight down towards the two crabs.  One was able to jump backwards out of the way at the last second, but the other crab was not so lucky.  It was quickly enveloped in the body of the octopus.  Sand shot up in a cloud, and then the struggling stopped as the octopus began to enjoy its meal.
 	
Andrew could only stare in awe at the scene below unfolding in front of him.  Dia gave him a gentle tap on the shoulder, then motioned that they should catch up with the rest of the group.  As they made their way forward, they caught up with the rest of the group and spent several more minutes moving about the reef.  They were about to cross through a large, natural divet in the reef when he heard a series of high-pitched, throaty clicking noises and squeaks behind him.  Turning to face the sound, the breathing piece nearly fell out of his mouth as he jaw dropped.
 	
Racing towards them was a pod of dolphins with light pink skin and a cream-white underside.  There must have been about fifteen or twenty dolphins in total, all spread out at varying distances.  Turning to look back at the group, he saw the gungan guide motion for the group to stop and spread out.  As they did so, he quickly swam back and positioned himself in the middle of the group.  As if it was already pre-scripted, the lead dolphin changed course slightly and made its way towards the gungan.  In one fluid motion the gungan gently but firmly took hold of the dolphin’s dorsal fin, and the two became one. The dolphin continued to stream forward effortlessly, and one by one the other dive members took hold of dolphins that came near them.
 	
Removing the breathing piece temporarily from her mouth, Dia gave a muffled “Hold on tight!” before taking hold of the dolphin that had made its way towards her.  Seconds later, a second dolphin approached Andrew.  He reached out and took hold of its dorsal fin -- and was unprepared for the surge of energy the dolphin made as it gave a few extra kicks to catch up with the dolphin that Dia had taken hold of.  He nearly lost his grip, but managed to hold on and reposition himself after a few seconds.  As his dolphin moved up beside Dia’s, she turned and flashed him a quick smile and a wink, clearly amused at his attempt to hold on.
 	
Up ahead, he could see the dolphins pairing off into two parallel lines, making their way through the hole in the reef.  The dolphins and their riders cleared it easily without bumping into the sides before suddenly disappearing.  When it was their turn, Andrew felt his dolphin begin pumping its peduncle and flukes more rapidly, increasing their speed.  Dia’s did the same.  
 	
As they cleared the reef, the two dolphins immediately rotated their bodies one-hundred-and-eighty degrees, then made a sharp ninety-degree turn to dive downwards before rotating again and racing down what must have been an underwater cliff face of some sort.  Internally, Andrew gave a scream of excitement and terror as the dolphins continued their sprint.
 	
After a few seconds, the dolphins leveled off as they neared the sea floor.  Andrew looked, bewildered, at Dia who was clearly laughing at the excitement and his misfortune.  Waves of air bubbles escaped from her mouth and moved out into the ocean.  Before he could do anything else, he felt the dolphin swerve left.  Looking forward, his eyes widened.
 	
They were approaching what could only be described as an underwater forest of coral-like trees.  Long stripes of seaweed extended up below them, their finger-like blades rippling with the motion of water as the dolphins and their passengers streaked by.  Wide-eyed fish darted out of the way while sea anemones of every color and combination covered almost every inch of the trunks and branches.  Some tentacles waved in every direction, while others retracted their tentacles into their bodies.
 	
The pairs of dolphins deftly wove their way through the structures around them with enough precision that their riders were not harmed.  The entire experience was similar to weaving through an asteroid field or a canyon without as much danger, though one that was exhilarating and colorful beyond imagination.  When the group cleared the coral-like forest, the dolphins broke for a large mound of rock that had several openings. 
 	
As Andrew and Dia’s dolphins entered one of the openings, the tunnel was lit by a type of seaweed that had a natural bioluminescent glow.  It provided just enough light so that they could see their path, as well as each other.  Soon, they emerged from the tunnel into a large, open-area.  Several rocks jutted up like pointed pillars, and bioluminescent jellyfish gently floated around the rocks aimlessly.  The dolphins began to move upwards until they breached the surface of what must have been a natural air pocket.
 	
The gungan let go of his dolphin and made his way over towards a rock ledge that was sticking out from one of the walls.  Climbing out of the water and standing up, he made his way over to a small table that had supplies and lamps, one of which was already on.  When all the group members had surfaced, they let go of their dolphins, who remained near their passengers.  Several dolphins made clicking sounds.
 	
“First of all,” began the gungan as he approached the edge of the rock platform with a lamp and box, “mesa want to thank our boyo and girlo dolphins for their ride.  Thank you, boyos and girlos!”  With that, the dolphins made some splashes with their fins and some gleeful sounds which reverberated pleasantly inside the rock chamber.  Setting the lit lamp down, the guide took the box in both hands and opened it.  “Now, before you gosa,” continued the gungan, “yousa all know how we thank our guests.  Kiss kiss!”
 	
With that, the dolphins let out a gleeful series of clicks in unison, then closed their beaks and gave a two-second kiss on the cheek to each rider.  Laughter erupted from the group at the unexpected gesture from the dolphins.  When this was done, the dolphins made their way over to the far side of the platform, eagerly awaiting whatever was in the box that the gungan held.
 	
“Now, if yousa would make your way over here, you can take a quick break before we move on while I feeds our boyos and girlos.  Mesa won’t be long.”
 	
The group members began to swim over to the ledge and climbed out one at a time.  As they did so, the gungan reached into the box and took out a medium-sized fish.  Throwing it in the air, the first dolphin dove then launched itself into the air from the water.  It performed a cartwheel as it caught the fish, then dove back down into the water.  As it consumed its reward, it swam away towards the tunnel that it had entered.  The other dolphins more or less did the same, much to the delight of the group.
 	
“Did you know this would be part of the tour?” Andrew asked quietly, looking at Dia.
 	
“Truthfully, no,” she said. “Though I did enjoy the look of surprise and alarm your face a few times.”
 	
Andrew smiled and shook his head as she gave him a wink.
 	
When the dolphins had left, the gungan turned to address the group again.
 	
“Thisa structure is a natural underground cavern.  Nickname isa the Shimmering Caves causa the way the light moves in the tunnels.  Yousa get to see this soon.  If you make your way through that path,” he said, pointing towards a pathway with an opening, “yousa can find the Shimmering Tunnel Network.  Itsa network you can explore.  Yousa no needsa get worried about being lost, as each pathway takes yousa back up to the surface eventually.  Wesa meet the sailing skiff there.  For now, yousa should take one of thesea underwater lamps to help guide you.  Remember, pressa the red button on your swim suits if yousa need help.”
 	
With that, the group members moved forward to take lamps and attach them to the hooks on their waists.  When they were ready, they moved as a group through the pathway and tunnel until it came to a fair-sized open pool.  In the water below, they could make out more bioluminescent jellyfish and seaweed, as well as a dozen different tunnels.  Andrew felt Dia gently touch his left arm from behind and leaned in to whisper in his ear.
 	
“Let’s wait until they go in.  See which tunnels they don’t take.”
 	
Andrew turned slightly to face her, an eyebrow raised at her curious suggestion, then gave her a slight nod in agreement.  Before long, the other divers had entered the pool and selected their own tunnel to explore.  This left only two tunnels that had not been chosen.
 	
“So,” said Andrew, taking her hand once more. “Shall we check out the left one first?”
 	
“Sounds like a plan,” she said with a smile.
 	
They both inserted their breathing apparatuses and entered the pool of water together, letting go of each other once in so that they could swim efficiently.  The jellyfish were spread out enough to not be a major concern.  He entered the tunnel first, his lamp giving just enough light to show the way through the crystal-clear water.  The light shimmered off the walls of the tunnel, giving off a sparkling array of colors that made it seem like they were swimming through a glittering rainbow.  Small dents and alcoves hinted that the tunnel may have had other secrets contained within it.  They tried a few, none of which were overly exciting.  After a few minutes, they found themselves at a fork in the road, so to speak.  Andrew shone his light down the left tunnel, then the right.  The rockface continued to glitter when he did so.  Not missing a beat, Dia pointed to the right tunnel and continued forward.
 	
This time, they entered an area that had a connecting side-tunnel on either side -- which probably connected with the other tunnels -- as well as a rock plateau similar to where they stopped earlier with the dolphins.  They emerged from the water, their lamps giving just enough light to illuminate the area and each other.  
 	
“I have to say,” said Andrew, disconnecting his lamp rod and grabbing the edge of the rock platform, “I’m surprised there are air pockets down here.”
 	
“Must be some natural air tunnel networks that are part of the rock structure,” said Dia, doing the same. “Explains partly why the air isn’t stale.  And,” she said, pointing at the rock face walls above them, “why the lichen can grow here.”  Taking both of the lamp rods, she slowly shone them at the pale white strands that dotted the walls.  After about a minute she placed the lamp rods back on the rock ledge and switched them off, leaving them in near darkness.
 	
“Hey--!” Andrew began, before he felt two of her fingers land on his lips to prevent him from speaking further.
 	
“Hush,” she said, “just watch.”
 	
It didn’t take long before something happened.  As they held onto the rock ledge and gently kicked their legs and free arm to keep themselves afloat, the lichen began to emit a soft blue glow.  After several seconds, the color changed to a luminescent green, then yellow, then purple.  Soon the colors began to ripple and change in waves.
 	
“I don’t believe it,” Andrew said in awe of the spectacle before him.
 	
“I’ve never seen this variety before,” said Dia, “but I figured it was similar to other cave lichen in the area.  Just the smallest amount of light causes them to emit a powerful glow.  So, what do you think?”
 	
He turned to face her.  The shifting rainbow of colors danced off her blue face and lekku just enough that he could make out some of her features in the darkness.  Using his free hand, he reached up and stroked her left lekku.  The lekku gave a slight twitch, and she let out a gentle “ah” of pleasure.  He guided his hand to cup her cheek, and could see her eyes glinting in the darkness.
 	
“I think,” he said, meeting her eyes, “you’re absolutely beautiful in this light.”
 	
Without missing a beat, he could just make out what must have been a blushing smile.  She wrapped her free arm around his body, and moved closer towards him.  Her wet, warm lips met his, and they became lost in that moment exchanging one kiss after another.
 	
“I wish,” she said, breaking her lips from his and taking a short gasp for a breath, “that we could stay here longer.”
 	
“Me too,” he said, kissing her again. 
 	
“And I wish,” she continued between kisses, “that this war would end.  And we could be together.”
 	
“We are,” he said, quickly gasping for a breath before kissing her again, then began moving to kiss her exposed neck.  She gave another slight moan of pleasure.
 	
“But,” she said with a small giggle, “we can’t keep the group waiting.”
 	
“I know,” he said, stopping just long enough to meet her eyes again. “But I don’t think they need to see the most beautiful woman in the entire galaxy right now.”
 	
“Talk less, kiss more,” she said before kissing him more deeply this time.  He placed his hand on her waist and drew her even closer.  Their warm bodies pressed against one another.
 	
And it was at that exact moment that their gungan guide interrupted them.
 	
“Whasa matter?” he asked as his head broke the water a few feet behind them. “Are yousa both okay?”
 	
Dia gave a slight scream of surprise and let go of Andrew while he spun around to face the gungan. 
 	
“Uh, we’re fine,” Andrew said, blinking at the gungan for several seconds. “We must have, uh, accidentally pressed the buttons against the rock face earlier.  Sorry.”
 	
“It’s okaysa,” said the gungan. “Yousa be surprised how often thisa happens during the trips.”  
 	
They both gave a nervous round of laughter. 
 	
“Oh,” said Andrew, his lips and teeth barely moving, “I’m sure it does.”
 	
“Yousa betcha,” said the gungan, smiling at them. “And at least yousa not acting like love fishies or anything.”
 	
They both stared at the gungan, not saying a word.
 	
“Unless,” he continued, moving his head back and forth, “yousa are being like love fishies.  But mesa no judge.” 
 	
With that, he disappeared underneath the water and began taking the tunnel to their right.
 	
Dia let go of him. “Come on,” she said as she grabbed their lamp rods and handed him his. “We shouldn’t keep them waiting.” As she lit the light she dove under water. Andrew gave a sigh of frustration.
 	
“Well,” he said, his shoulders sinking as he switched on his light. “At least it wasn’t something I said.”

They emerged several minutes later from a natural donut-shaped tunnel that was in the middle of a cove of what must have been a small island.  Red-and-orange rock structures jutted up around them, connecting to a larger overhanging rock.  Yellow-blue seabirds cawed and flew around them, their nests built into the indents of the rocks above them.  As they moved away from the circle, they were able to place their feet on solid ground, which was a mix of smooth rocks and sand.  The water was knee-deep, and small waves splashed against them as the water ebbed and flowed around them.  Several of the sea-birds dove in the distance into the water, then emerged several seconds later with fish caught in their beaks.  With a few flaps of their wings, they were airborne again, heading back towards their nests.
 	
As the group gathered around, sharing stories of their discoveries while in the tunnels, the gungan instructor moved to stand in front of them. In the distance, they could see and hear the sea skiff approaching.
 	
“Mesa like toa take this opportunity to thank you allsa for joining this tour, and hopes you enjoyed your experience. If yousa coulda line up here, the skiffsa will drop a ladder for you allsa to climb.”
 	
As the skiff stopped, a ladder lowered from the side. One by one the group members made their way over to it and climbed up onto the main deck.  At the back of the line, as Andrew and Dia made their way with the rest of the group members, something glinted out of the corner of his eye. Looking down in the water, he saw a series of smooth stones of varying sizes and colors.  Nestled just underneath two stones was another that looked brighter and had a ruby-red like color.  As Dia moved forward, he bent down and fished for it, plucking it out of the water.  Examining it in his palm, it had an almost gem-like quality to it, giving it the appearance that it might hold some value.
 	
“You coming?” he heard her ask.  He looked to see her staring back at him.
 	
“Yeah,” he said, standing up and pocketing the stone.  Walking towards her, they reached the skiff.  He was the last to climb up the ladder.  As they sat on one of the benches, she turned to face him.
 	
“What did you pick up in the water?” she asked.
 	
“Oh, just a memento. For this place.  I don’t think we’ll be back here anytime soon.”
 	
“Not anytime soon, no,” she said.  Then, after a moment, “but maybe someday.”
 	
“Yeah,” he said, putting an arm around her.  She bent her head slightly and rested it on his shoulder. “Maybe someday.”

Half an hour later, the skiff reached the dock where it had taken off.  The group members departed down a boarding plank and made their way to the changing areas.  After a quick private shower, he got dressed and met Dia outside near the waiting area.  From there they retrieved their personal belongings from the check-in desk, and made their way towards a food court in the distance.  A warm breeze blew in from the water, and the odd bird or two flew overhead.  Other patrons and vacationers milled about the area.
 	
“I’m starving,” she said, surveying the numerous food vendors as they approached the food court.
 	
“So, one of everything then?” he asked playfully.
 	
“Ha,” she laughed, “and ruin my figure? No way.  But I know one thing that will hit the spot.”
 	
“Oh?” he asked, raising an eyebrow at her.
 	
“Yeah,” she said, pointing towards one that had a dragon-like sea creature extending across the top. “Sushi!”
 	
They sat down ten minutes later at a table with two trays full of food, dipping sauces, and their drinks under a row of beach trees that provided ample shade from the high-noon sun. They sampled the varieties of sushi, seafood pieces, and vegetables that came with their dishes, dipping them in sauces or eating them outright.
 	
“So delicious,” she said, her mouth half-full of food.  Dipping a piece of red-pink meat with white stripes in some soy sauce with her eating sticks, she brought it to his mouth.  Opening his, she slipped the meat inside.  The combination of salty liquid with the tangy fish exploded in his mouth.  He, likewise, did the same with her with a piece of vegetable sushi wrapped in a dark-colored seaweed.
 	
“I have to say,” he said through a mouthful of food, “this is delicious.  Unlike the food we are served in the Mess Hall.”
 	
“I hear that,” she said, swallowing her mouthful of food. “There’s only one thing that is consistent between here and onboard a star cruiser.”
  	
“Oh?” he asked, finishing his own mouthful. “And what is th--?”
 	
Using her right hand, she reached up and around his cheek, pulling his face to hers.  Their lips met briefly, and she pulled away smiling.
 	
“You have terrible table manners,” she said, and turned to dip a piece of vegetable in a pale-yellow mustard before popping it in her mouth. “You had some soy sauce on the side of your mouth.”
 	
“I have bad table manners?” he asked incredulously, but playfully. He noticed a small smudge of mustard on her lips. “Have you seen yourself after you’ve eaten a powdered donut?”
 	
“I’ll have you know,” she began, looking at him and leaning forward, an eating stick pointed at him, “that I have impeccable--”.
 	
He leaned in, connecting his lips with hers.  She pulled away, a smirk on her face.
 	
“I believe you had some mustard on your lips,” he told her.
 	
“Really?” she said with a small laugh. “Is it still there?”
 	
“I can’t really tell,” he said with a smile. “But it never hurts to be sure.”
 	
They kissed again several times.  It took a seabird to break them apart.
 	
As the yellow-white bird landed with a clatter on the table, its long, curved beak shot forward and snatched a piece of meat from her plate.  It quickly gobbled it down, and made to snatch a second.
 	
“Hey!” she called, waving at the bird. “Shoo! Shoo! Get out of here! Get!”
 	
The bird took off with a honk, and began its ascent upwards and away from the table.  A few other patrons nearby laughed casually at the scene before returning to their meals.  Her cheeks turning bright red from embarrassment, Dia turned to look at him.
 	
“Well,” she said with a sigh, placing her chin on an open palm and pushing her tray away. “There goes my meal.”
 	
“Maybe,” he said as she pushed her plate away. “But I think I still have enough to share.”  Dipping a piece of sushi in a red sauce this time, he brought it to her lips.  Without missing a beat, she opened her mouth and ate the piece of sushi.
 	
“Well,” she said, turning and meeting his eyes, “at least I have the most considerate boyfriend this side of the galaxy.”

Contessa Suli deChenzzi sat in a beach chair on the deck outside of her main office.  Reports had come trickling in all morning, some with good news, others with unwelcome news.  The oppressive mid-day sun beat down on her skin, adding to her foul mood.  The only thing that made sitting outside at this moment bearable was the cool breeze, offsetting some of the heat -- though that paled in comparison to her worrying about her missing husband, Firith.
 	
Hearing the door slide open behind her, she lowered her sunglasses and used her lipstick mirror to see who was approaching.  It was her chief of security.
 	
“Beg your pardon, ma’am,” said the chief, stopping a few feet away. “But I bring news that is of great importance.”
 	
“Come forward, Miguel,” she said, snapping the mirror shut and pushing her sunglasses back up. “Now,” she said, sitting up in her chair. “What do you have for me?”
 	
Miguel straightened and stepped forward, handing her a data pad.
 	
“Reports from the eastern province, ma’am.  And another from Baterron.”
 	
She read through each report quickly, gleaming the important facts.  She sighed, and set the data pad on her lap. 
 	
“That’s the third raid this month, Miguel.  They’re becoming more frequent and bolder.”
 	
“They are, ma’am, yes,” he began.
 	
“And how do we defend against such incursions while ensuring the safety of our guests?  We can’t keep this from the media forever.”
 	
Miguel shifted uncomfortably from where he stood.
 	
“A difficult task, ma’am,” he said carefully. “But we may have a lead for the next one.”
 	
“Chief,” she said sternly, “I want proof, not leads.  You know as well as I that local security forces can’t act on a hunch.”
 	
“No, ma’am,” he said, nodding his head in agreement, “they can’t.  But, if we can catch them in the act, that may provide enough evidence to have local forces move in.  And, if we might enlist the help of the New Republic in orbit --”
 	
“No,” she cut in sharply.  “If we involve them now, whomever is pulling the strings behind these abductions will be tipped off, and we’ll never rescue those who have been taken.  We will only enlist their help as a last resort.”  She sighed and stood up from her chair, removing her sunglasses.  “Now, tell me what your lead is.”
 	
“All of the targets to date have been, for lack of better words, ritzy events.  Some private ones, too.  Small enough to be away from a major security presence, but enough people to kidnap with a few transports and armed troops.  While I don’t have concrete facts, I do have a possible source that may have revealed the next target.”
 	
“Which is?” she asked, raising an eyebrow.
 	
“Tomorrow’s cruise event,” he said, folding his arms in front of him. “And the Contessa’s Cup.”
 	
“How reliable is your source?” she asked.
 	
“My source is reliable,” he said, shifting uncomfortably, “but the information is second-hand.”
 	
“Second-hand?” she asked incredulously.
 	
“Apologies, ma’am,” he said, choosing his words carefully. “But it is the best lead we have.”
 	
“Again, Chief, I want proof, not leads,” she said tersely, then walked past him and placed both hands on the railing, leaning against it. Then, a thought dawned on her. “Though … you may, in fact, be right.  The cruise ship will be isolated from local security at the resort, and there will be more than enough people on the ship.”
 	
“Not to mention a number of high profile patrons; including yourself and Mister Solari, ma’am.”
 	
_Solari?_ she thought. _What’s he up to this time?_ “If I might say, ma’am,” said Miguel, taking a few steps towards her. “I’d rest easier ensuring your safety by not attending the event.”
 	
“No,” she said, turning around. Walking over to him, she placed a soft hand on his shoulder. “I appreciate your concern and loyalty as always, Miguel, but I must ensure the safety of our guests.  I am also fully capable of taking care of myself.”
 	
“Very well, ma’am,” he said as she removed her hand, “but at least let me add some extra security detail.  Undercover, of course.  And may I also suggest a personal tracker, just to be safe?”
 	
“You worry too much, Miguel,” she said with a slight chuckle. “But both are excellent ideas.  See to it.”
 	
“Ma’am!” he said, nodding to her.  
 	
“One more thing, Chief,” she said as he made to move away. He stopped and turned back to face her. “I have two other important guests I need you to keep safe.  I’ll forward you the information later.”
 	
“As you wish, ma’am,” said Miguel, then turned to leave and attend to his duties.
 	
With that, she turned back and walked over to the railing once more.  Off in the distance she could see the cruise ship in the bay, small shuttles and transports ferrying supplies towards it. She gave a heavy sigh of frustration and despair.
 	

_This had better work_, she thought to herself. _Or there will be no coming back from this._
