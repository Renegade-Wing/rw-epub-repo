Chapter 6
:::
 	
The rest of the day proved to be eventual for the two vacationers.  After their lunch, Dia took him on a two-hour winding climb up one of the nearby mountain paths.  They stopped at the summit where a number of other vacationers milled about, admiring the view below.  Standing on one of the metal lookout pads, Andrew and Dia admired what they witnessed below them.  The resort and its outlying buildings, as well as other residential areas, dotted the landscape.  Transports took off or arrived with their passengers.  In the bay they could make out the crescent-shaped beach with its white sand snaking off into the distance, not to mention some smaller islands off in a distance, as well as the cruise ship which looked like a toy in a bathtub from this distance.  Birds chirped and sang songs, and some fluttered near them or sat perched in the odd tree that was on the summit.
 	
“It’s quite the view,” he said, his sweaty shirt sticking to him as he wrapped an arm around her waist. 
 	
“Sure is,” she said, repeating his gesture.  They stood there in silence for some time, enjoying their company.  
 	
It was Dia who eventually broke the silence.
 	
“Hold out your hand,” she said.
 	
“Why?” he asked, looking at her.
 	
“Just trust me,” she said, returning the look. “Hold out your hand, then extend your index finger like you’re pointing.”
 	
“Okay,” he said, raising his arm outwards in front of him. “What am I pointing at?”
 	
“Just point,” she said, “and you’ll see.”
 	
“Okay, but I don’t see what--.”
 	
He felt something flutter against his hand and grab hold of his index finger.  A small bird with red feathers and a yellow underbody had landed on his finger.  It extended its blue-tipped wings outwards, then closed them against its body.  The bird also had two tail-feathers that extended past its body, presumably used to help it maneuver in flight.
 	
He froze, not making a movement.  The bird eyed him quizzically.
 	
“Don’t make any sudden movements,” she said quietly.  Sticking out her arm, she had only to wait a few seconds for another bird to land on her finger.  There was one small difference this time; this bird had three small black diamond-shaped markings on its chest.
 	
“What are they?” he asked quietly, not making any movements.
 	
“These are Eudorian mountain swallows.  The one you have is a male; this one with the markings is a female.  They’re friendly to humanoids sometimes.”
 	
“So … what do I do?” he asked, still not moving a muscle.  The perched bird continued to eye him.
 	
“Move your arm slowly like mine,” she said, turning hers back into an L-shape so that her bird looked at her.  After a few seconds, he did the same.  Both birds looked at each other, then them, before giving a few chirps. “Now,” she said slowly, “watch this.”  Puckering her lips to whistle, she whistled four slow notes, modifying each one to make a pleasant sound.  The birds turned their attention to her, chirping a few notes in response. 
 	
“I don’t get--” he began.
 	
“Hush,” she cut in, then repeated the same notes.
 	
The birds appeared to nod in understanding.  It was then that they began their song.  Their sounds were sweet and melodious, almost as if the two were having a singing recital and conversation at the same time.  
 	
When they were finished, Dia bowed her head.
 	
“Do the same,” she said quietly.  Andrew did.
 	
In turn, the two birds extended their feathers and bowed, then took off into the air and circled behind them.  They both turned to watch them fly off as other vacationers milled about.
 	
“How did you--” he began, looking to face her.
 	
“A bit of practice,” she said, flashing a grin at him. “I made a lot of trips up here when I was younger with my uncle.  He loved getting away from the office and being in nature whenever he could.  He taught me how to attract the birds and not scare them off.”
 	
“How, exactly?” Andrew asked her, furrowing his brow.
 	
“Trade secret,” she said with a wink. “The birds won’t do it for just anyone.  Some believe the birds only perform for those who have a strong personal connection, or are deeply in love.”
 	
“Huh,” he said, turning to look at several of the birds perched in a nearby tree.
 	
“Come on,” she said, letting go of his waist and pulling him by the hand. “Let’s get going.  There’s still so much more to do, and the day is still young.”
 	
“Like what?” he asked.
 	
“Maglining,” she said, continuing to pull him forward.
 	
“Maglining?” he asked. “What’s that?”
 	
“A lot like ziplining,” she said as they made their way towards a small structure.  Once inside, he saw several staff members in orange shirts giving demonstrations or standing near large open doorways with small lines of people.
 	
“I don’t understand, and I’ve never done either of those activities,” he said, moving along with her.
 	
“The long and short of everything,” she said, stopping to look up at him, is that it is the fastest and funnest way to get down from here.  Unless you’d rather walk down the mountain again.”
 	
“Well … I did enjoy the view from behind on the way up the mountain as you walked ahead of me,” he began.  Her expression changed to a flat but stern look of incredulity. “Maglining it is,” he said without missing a beat. “How does it work?”
 	
Before she could respond, they were interrupted by one of the instructors.
 	
“Well if it isn’t Miss Dia Tann,” said the instructor as he walked up to them, his hair combed back with grey wings streaking his temples. “To what do I owe the pleasure of your company this fine day?”
 	
“Heya, Charlie!” she exclaimed, giving him a quick hug. “How are you?”
 	
“Pretty good for an old fella,” he said, flashing her a smile. “I haven’t seen you in ages.  You’ve grown to become quite the woman, I see. What have you been up to since I last saw you?”
 	
“Oh, you know, running around the galaxy with the New Republic.  Trying to stay out of trouble.  You know, the usual.”
 	
“The New Republic,” he said, caught off-guard. “What are you doing with a bunch of mud-skupping hooligans like them?”
 	
“It’s not all that bad,” she said with a small laugh. “And they’re not all mud-skuppers.  The Alliance took moof-milkers and nerfherders, too.  Including some of the brainless ones,” she said, wrapping an arm around and leaning up against Andrew.  “Isn’t that right, dear?”
 	
“Oh, I’m not so sure about that,” said Andrew nervously as Charlie met his gaze, eying him carefully.
 	
“Well,” he said slowly, “any man that Dia has an interest in must be a good one to keep around.” Charlie stuck out his arm to shake Andrew’s hand. “I trust you’re taking good care of her, son?”
 	
“Only the best,” he said, taking Charlie’s firm hand and shaking it.
 	
“Good,” said Charlie as he pointed a finger in his face. “Because if I ever find out that you mistreat her, there won’t be a place in the galaxy safe enough for you.”
 	
Andrew stared at the finger in front of him, fearing for his life if only slightly.  He stood like that for several seconds before Charlie broke into laughter and started slapping him on the shoulder.
 	
“I’m kidding,” he said, “it’s what I do.”  Andrew laughed nervously in response.  “And, hey,” Charlie said, stopping to put a firm hand on Andrew’s shoulder, “in truth, I really appreciate what you two and the New Republic are doing.  It’s not perfect, but it’s a helluva lot better than what things were like under the Emperor.  C’mon, let’s get you two set up.”
 	
It took only a few minutes for him to show them how to put the harness on.  Dia, having done this many times before, had no problem.  Andrew, on the other hand, initially put his harness on backwards.  Charlie cracked a few jokes at this, while Dia tried to stifle her laughter.  Once that was sorted out, they were ready to go.
 	
“All you need to do now is activate your mag belt,” said Charlie, flicking on the one he held in his hand.  Andrew and Dia did the same.  Purple ribbons of energy connected with the mag line at an angle that they were standing under.  “The mag belt will be secure enough to support your weight.  If for any reason it stops operating, don’t worry.  Safety nets run down the mountainside to catch you.”
 	
“Has anyone,” Andrew asked, looking at him, “ever … you know….”
 	
“We haven’t had any belt failures for the last ten years running,” he said.  “We take the utmost safety with the lines and our clients.  Med crews are also on stand-by in case anything happens.”
 	
Andrew turned to look at the steep drop in front of him.  The trees below looked like spikes ready to impale someone.  He could make out parts of the net below him.
 	
“Oh, I’m not so sure about this,” he said, feeling his stomach begin to roll as he stepped up to the jump-off point.
 	
“There’s a first time for everything, dear,” he heard Dia say as she stood up on her tiptoes behind him and kissed his cheek.  “Ladies first!”  
 	
He felt her hands connect with his back, shoving him forward.  Losing his balance and giving a cry of surprise, he tumbled forward and let gravity take hold.  He was just able to hear Charlie begin to roar with laughter.
 	
Watching Andrew sail downwards, Dia got ready to launch herself.
 	
“Hey, Dia,” said Charlie, placing a hand on her shoulder as she stepped up to the launch point. “Before you go, I just wanna say that I’m really sorry to hear about your uncle.  He was a real great guy.  I hope they find him.”
 	
“Thank you, Charlie,” she said, turning to rest her hand on his. “I appreciate it.”  She flashed him a smile. “You should stop in and see Auntie sometime. I’m sure she’d love a visit.”
 	
“Will do, kiddo,” he said, giving her a wink.
 	
With that, she leapt forward and let gravity take hold.  Andrew had some distance on her, but she could still hear him screaming.  She, on the other hand, laughed all the way down.
 	
It took several minutes, but Andrew was the first to reach the bottom. As his mag belt disconnected, he landed on some sort of inflatable padding that mostly broke his fall and momentum, though that didn’t stop him from tumbling forward a few metres.  Dia, on the other hand, was able to hit the pad and stop herself not far from where she landed.
 	
As Andrew lay there, bewildered, she walked over to him and broke into a fit of laughter.
 	
“You,” she began between breaths and giggles, “should see … your face … too … funny!”
 	
Andrew stared back up at her, not saying a word.
 	
“Come on,” she said, bending down to grab his hands, “we need to clear the landing pad.”
 	
“Are there any more surprises today?” he asked, leaning on her to keep his balance.
 	
“Mmm … maybe.  Who’s to say?” she said with an amused look on her face.

The rest of the afternoon was spent walking along the beach hand-in-hand near their rental cottage.  Although tired from the day’s activities, she had convinced him to take a dip in the ocean with her.  The water was warm and soothing, the breeze cool and gentle.  It wasn’t until shortly around supper time that they decided to leave the ocean and head back to the apartment.  As they walked up the stone path from the beach, small beach lamps lining the pathway, they could just make out BD-B2 hopping excitedly up and down from one of the window ledges inside of the house.
 	
“Looks like someone is happy to see you,” he said tiredly, his feet and legs aching from the day’s excursions.
 	
“I like to think happy to see us,” she said with a tired sigh.
 	
They both stopped at the rinsing station just before the deck and took but a minute to clean the salt water and sand from their bodies before grabbing towels they had left just inside the door from the deck.  BD-B2 scurried along the floor and hopped out onto the deck, buzzing and chirping with excitement.
 	
“Hey, Bee-Two,” said Dia, reaching down to scratch the little droid underneath his head.  The droid purred in affection.
 	
“So, what now?” Andrew asked, placing the towel along the backside of a chair.
 	
“I’m going to go change,” she said, standing up. “You’re going to raid the fridge and cupboards and cook supper.”
 	
“Oh,” he said, his shoulders sinking. “Great. What do you want?”
 	
“Something delicious. Like last night’s meal,” she said.
 	
“Uh huh,” he said as she took off inside.  Heading towards the kitchen, he began to tear apart the fridge and cupboards, looking for something to cook.  After a few minutes he was able to gather several vegetables, fruit, herbs, butter, some rice, and what appeared to be a type of white fish from the fridge.  He also found a bottle of chilled white wine that could be used for cooking or drinking. Firing up the grill, he set to work preparing the vegetables and fish.  After several minutes he set these in the grill to cook, then began to prepare the rice alongside the fish sauce.  It wasn’t long before the aromas began to waft throughout the house.
 	
“Smells wonderful,” said Dia as she came down the stairs.  Walking over to the stove, she wrapped her arms around him and once more stood on her tiptoes to reach around and kiss his cheek.
 	
“I try,” he said with a smile.  “I need to check the grill.  Can you keep stirring this?”
 	
“Sure,” she said, taking over for him.
 	
As he opened the grill, he reached for the tongs and flipped the foil-wrapped items over, then closed the lid.  The fish was also beginning to grill nicely.  Another twenty minutes or so, and the meal would be ready.  When he entered the kitchen again, Dia went for the glass cupboard and withdrew a wine glass.  She was about to pour herself some of the wine when he stopped her.
 	
“I wouldn’t do that,” he said. “You’ll ruin the flavour of the meal if you drink that now.”
 	
“Not even a little?” she asked, the glass and wine bottle tipped at an angle, though no liquid escaping its vessel.
 	
“Not even a little,” he said.
 	
“Spoilsport,” she huffed, setting both the bottle and glass down.  She kissed him on the cheek again before she headed outside. “This better be a good meal to make me wait on wine,” she said.
 	
“I hope to hell it is,” he muttered to himself, squeezing juice from a lemon into the sauce mixture as she exited the room, the light curtain flapping from the breeze.

After retrieving the food from the grill less than half an hour later and plating it, he exited the apartment with two plates of food.  Dia lay on the deck chair, her blue legs spilling partly out of her orange beach dress with white flowers that complemented her new headpiece. She also wore a necklace of ovular wooden beads.  Tipping the sunglasses from her face slightly, she eyed him.
 	
“Dinner is served, m’lady,” he said, setting the plates down at the table.  
 	
“About time,” she said, removing the sunglasses and standing up. “I’m famished.”  Walking over to the table, he slid her chair out, waiting until she was just about to sit down, then pushed it in for her.  “Look at you, being all chivalrous,” she said, placing her chin in her open palm, elbow leaning against the table. “Now, where’s my wine.”
 	
“Ah, ah, not yet,” Andrew said as he took his seat.  Steam rose from the two plates into the air, and the deck lights began to flicker on as the sun began to set.
 	
“Not exactly what I want to hear,” she said, picking up her fork and digging into the fish covered in sauce and herbs. Andrew remained silent, watching her intently and holding his breath in anticipation.  She moved the fork towards her mouth. “This damn well better be…,” she began as she put the fork full of food into her mouth.  She stopped talking to savour the food in her mouth. “Oh my gosh,” she said, swallowing her food and digging at the fish again, “oh my gosh, this is the best fish I have ever tasted.”  
 	

_Oh thank god,_ thought Andrew, breathing a silent sigh of relief.
 	
“What’s your secret?” she asked.
 	
“A true chef never reveals his secrets,” Andrew said, beginning to pick away at his meal. “You should try the vegetables and rice.”
 	
She made to try the other foods on her plate, savouring each bite. 
 	
“My god man,” she said after several mouthfuls of food. “Why have I not known your secret talents?  Why are you not part of the kitchen staff on the cruisers?!”
 	
“It’s more of a hobby,” he said, “and I wouldn’t consider myself a master of cuisine.”
 	
“I thoroughly disagree,” she said, reaching for her glass of cold water.

Having finished their meal, they enjoyed the rest of the evening on the deck.  They made casual conversation, and watched as beachgoers made their way along the beach.  The sun had lowered, yet still provided enough light to see, casting its shimmering shadow of orange and purples along the ocean. Sailing skiffs dotted the coastline, though many had begun to make their way back to harbor.  Baterron loomed above them, its ringed cities and settlements glinting from its surface like a lesser version of Coruscant.
 	
When it became too chilly to stay out any longer, they went inside.  Leaving the dishes and cookware on the counter for later, they made their way to the living room to curl up together and talk more on the couch.  Rather than use a lamp to light the room, they had opted for the synthetic fireplace to light the room.  Orange flames gave light that cascaded gentle throughout the room, giving it a warm and comforting feeling.
 	
“So you’re telling me,” said Dia between laughs, “that the Wing Commander had several pilots put on tug duty, all because of some misadventure with plushie porgs?”
 	
“Oh yes,” said Andrew between laughs, “you should have seen the Imperials, too.  They were not impressed.”
 	
“That is too funny,” she said, wiping a tear away from her eye. “I wish that I had been there.” She reached to squeeze the hand of his arm that was draped loosely across her shoulder and chest. “I wish I could be with you.” 
	
“And I, you,” he said, gently kissing her head. “Now,” he said, removing his arm. “I think you’ll like this next part.”
 	
“Oh?” she said, sitting up so that he could move.  Getting up, he walked into the kitchen.  He opened the fridge to remove a new bottle of wine, then retrieved a wine glass from the cupboard, as well as a small rectangular box from the pantry.  Bringing his treasure-trove back to the couch, Dia’s eyes lit up in delight.
 	
“Ooh!” she exclaimed. “What do we have here?”
 	
“A red wine, which I hope is suitable for my lady’s palate, and a box of dark chocolates.  I found these while I was rummaging around earlier.”
 	
Her face lit up with delight as he sat down next to her.  “You, good sir, have definitely scored some bonus points with me. Gimmi, gimmi, gimmi!”
 	
Using a wine screw to pop the cork out of the bottle, he poured the red wine into the glass as she tore the box of chocolates open.  She popped the first chocolate into her mouth, savouring the taste.  As he finished pouring the wine, he handed her the glass, which she eagerly brought to her lips.  As the wine combined with the chocolate, she let out a moan of pleasure.
 	
“Now this,” she said with her mouth partially full, “is bliss.”
 	
“I thought you might like it,” he said as she took a gulp this time from the glass of wine. “Though you might want to slow down.”
 	
“But it’s so good!” she said, pouting.
 	
“Yes, I know,” he said, taking her arm playfully.  She, instead, shifted her wine glass to the other hand. “But too much too soon will make you tipsy.”
 	
“Spoilsport,” she sighed, taking a chocolate from the box and popping it playfully into his mouth.
 	
Half a box of chocolates later, she was already part-way through her second glass of wine.
 	
“How are you feeling?” he asked, eying her.
 	
“A little tipsy,” she said, “but nothing I can’t handle.”  Immediately afterwards, a small hiccup escaped from her mouth.  “Oh my!” she exclaimed as she covered her mouth with an open palm, slightly embarrassed. 
 	
“Told you to pace yourself,” he said.
 	
“Yeah, yeah,”  she said as he took another sip from the wine glass.
