Chapter 8
:::
 	
The cruise ship was well underway by the time he had finished putting their clothing and other necessities away.  It had taken some time, too, to navigate the ship map so he could find the major locations, not to mention the dining and booking areas.  Each deck had a similar layout structurally, but contained different loadouts.  Some were for maintenance, a dozen others were for passengers, while others still were for shopping, dining, games, or luxury activities -- not to mention spaces for the hangar, engine rooms, the kitchens, crew quarters, security, bridge, the casino, and security.  There was even a small brig, presumably for rowdy patrons, or those who may have had one too many beverages to drink.
 	
When he returned to the suite, Dia was waiting.  Sprawled out on one of the beds, she was flipping through the events schedule.
 	
“Good,” she said, looking up as he came through the door. “You’re back.”
 	
“I am,” he said, closing the door behind him.  “Enjoy the sun?”
 	
“Very much so,” she said, tossing the data pad aside.  “We should get changed.  Hit up the buffet, then make our way to the hangar for racing practice and maintenance.”
 	
They changed, separately, into clothing that was more appropriate for blending in with the crowd of cruise goers, like regular people.  While the buffet line was long, they were able to make their way in and out quickly, filling their plates with pre-cooked food and wraps.  The food wasn’t half-bad, but he could cook better.  Then again, when one was cooking for an entire ship of people, quality wasn’t necessarily your primary focus.
 	
After that, they made their way down to the hangar where they were greeted by the flight crews and primary race organizer.  She introduced herself as ‘Skippy’, and gave them a rundown of the ships and the race rules and regulations.
 	
“Any chance we can get a test-flight for the racing course?” he asked at the end of the briefing.
 	
“Not until before the race during the warm-up period,” she said as they sat in her office.  “I can give you a blueprint of the racing circuit -- it’s made available to all the racers before each race -- to study.  But we won’t be arriving at the destination for another hour.”
 	
“That’s fair,” said Dia. “What about flight suits and protection?”
 	
“Everything will be provided.  You can suit up now, if you’d like, and wait in the racers’ lounge until it is time to launch.”
 	
“Peachy,” Dia said as she stood up.  Andrew followed her and the race organizer out of the office.  They were led into a room full of lockers.  A handful of other racers, male and female, human and alien alike, were in the middle of getting changed.
 	
“Heya, Chief,” said a male Duros, thumbing a hand towards Andrew and Dia as they entered the room. “Where’d you pick up these two mud-skuppers?”
 	
“Mud-skuppers?” spat Dia.  Andrew reached behind him and gently placed his hand on her arm, signalling to cool her jets.
 	
“Easy, Ledwin,” said the race organizer. “I’d like to introduce to you all some late entrants into our race.  This is Andrew and Dia. They’re pilots with the New Republic … and veterans of the Battle of Endor.”
 	
The room fell silent as all eyes fell on Andrew and Dia.  There was an uncomfortable silence as the racing pilots began exchanging glances with one another.  A green-skinned female Rodian moved up next to Ledwin.
 	
“Endor, you say?” said Ledwin, breaking the silence and zipping up his flight suit.  Stepping forward, he reached out a hand to offer a handshake. “Sorry for my off-hand comment earlier.  We wouldn’t be able to race here or on the other circuits if it wasn’t for brave folks such as yourself.”  Andrew took hold of Ledwin’s hand in return, as did Dia, who eyed him cooly.  
 	
“Uh, you’re welcome,” said Andrew. “But I’m not sure I understand.”
 	
“It all came down to a matter of race and ethnicity when the Empire was in charge,” said the female Rodian from behind Ledwin.
 	
“Ah, where are my manners?” said Ledwin, turning to motion for her to come forward. “This is Imzi, my number two.  Why don’t we let you get suited up first, and we can discuss racing after?”
 	
Ledwin showed them to their lockers.  Each locker contained a flight suit not dissimilar to those that the New Republic used.  The helmets were knock-off A-wing helmet types, though the life support system was fairly standard.  It didn’t take long for them to get suited up and make their way for the racing lounge.
 	
“What exactly did the Empire do here?” asked Dia as they sat down at a circular table several minutes later.
	
Imzi was the first to speak.  “A few years ago, the Empire outlawed aliens from the racing circuits.  Wanted to promote a human-based breed of racers to win the challenges -- all from Imperial worlds, of course,” she said. “Ledwin and I had to stick to the lesser racing circuits, saving what winnings we could in hopes of making it big.”
 	
“It wasn’t easy,” said Ledwin, shaking his head. “But after Endor, with the Empire in chaos, the rules changed.  We could finally move up to the more challenging races as of a month ago.”  He turned to smile at Imzi. “It wasn’t easy, and there were times when things were really lean.  But racing here is our next big step to making it on into the racing circuit on Baterron.”
 	
Andrew sat back in his chair, folding his arms across his chest. 
 	
“So, how much do you need to win?” he asked.
 	
“First place would do it,” said Ledwin, taking a drink from his glass. “But the best we’ve ever finished is third.”
 	
“How does the prize money scale?” Andrew asked.
 	
“First place, as you know dear, is ten-thousand credits,” said Dia.  “It scales downwards from there.  Second is seventy-five hundred, third is five-thousand.  There are some lesser prizes below that.”
 	
“Yeah,” said Imzi. “But with maintenance and crew costs, not to mention living costs, things have been tight.  We’re lucky to have made it this far.”
 	
“So clearly, winning is in your best interests,” said Andrew. “What happens if you place below third?”
 	
Ledwin shifted uncomfortably in his seat. “Third would help us break even. Allow us to compete in the next race in two days on Eudora.  If we win that, it gives us an entry position for the racing circuit on Baterron.”
 	
“Placing below third,” said Imzi apprehensively, “would be bad.”
 	
“How bad?” Andrew asked.
 	
“We’d,” said Imzi, looking at Ledwin, “have to give up racing. And sell our ships.”
 	
Dia leaned forward, looking at them intently. “You’re all-in on this, aren’t you?” she asked.
 	
They both nodded.
 	
“What are you thinking?” she asked, her voice rising slightly. “Not even this nerfherder of mine would make a mistake like that!”
 	
“Hey,” said Andrew, shooting her a look.  He was many things.  A nerfherder was not one of them.
 	
“I know,” said Ledwin. “But it’s our best shot unless….” He trailed off, looking over Andrew’s shoulder.  Giving Ledwin a puzzled look, Andrew and Dia turned to see what he had noticed.  Two new racers had entered the room.  They were Palliduvan females, both dressed in crimson flight suits with patches of sponsors stitched onto their arms and flight vests.  Both had their red hair tied back into ponytails with green hair bands.  Judging from the spitting image of both of them, Andrew figured that they were twins. “Oh no,” Ledwin said.
 	
“Who are they?” asked Dia, turning back to look at Ledwin and Imzi.
 	
“They’re the Red Angel sisters,” said Imzi, her shoulders sinking slightly. “They’re the best racing team this side of the galaxy.  With their Vaught-Krynex F8A Corsairs, they win first pretty well every time.”
 	
“They have big sponsors to boot. And usually collect the bonus prizes, too,” said Ledwin, finishing his drink. “No way we can compete with them.”
 	
“They shouldn’t even be in this race,” said Imzi sadly. “It’s just pocket-change for them.”
 	
Andrew turned to look at Dia, who gave him a thoughtful look.
 	
“Bonus prizes?” she asked, shifting her gaze back to Ledwin.
 	
Ledwin, in turn, slouched forward and propped himself up with a closed fist. 
 	
“Not all races have them,” he said, using his free hand to run a finger around the rim of his cup. “But the important ones do.  This year’s race has the Solari Star as a bonus prize.”
 	
“Solari?” asked Dia. “I’ve heard that name.”
 	
“Yeah,” said Imzi. “Korwin Solari.  Head of Solari Enterprises, and the richest man in the star system.  He typically funds a number of races, events, and charities.  Only the Contessa is second in wealth to him.  Nobody has won the Solari Star for the last four years running.”
 	
“How come?” Andrew asked with a puzzled look.
 	
Imzi threw a holo puck on the table.  The race course flashed to life.
 	
“After the main race,” she said as the hologram quickly moved through the main thoroughfare, “racers have a chance to continue on to the bonus award location.  In this case, Star Island.”  The hologram stopped at an island that was, more or less, the shape of a five-pointed star.  At each point was a cliff outcropping with a hole large enough for a starfighter to easily fly through.  “The final ring beacon is nestled in the center of the island. This ring is protected by an energy shield, which can only be brought down if you successfully cross through each set of sensors from the cliff outcroppings.”
 	
“Let me guess,” Andrew said. “There’s more to it than that, isn’t there?”
 	
“Sure is,” said Ledwin. “The entire island has ion cannon and mine defenses.  Get hit enough, and you crash -- possibly fatally.  To win the Solari Star, you also have to pass through the final ring on top of the mountain on the center island within fifteen seconds of clearing the final ring.  If you don’t, the shield goes back up, and nobody wins.”
 	
“Sounds risky if you ask me,” said Dia. “And illegal.”
 	
“It should be,” said Ledwin, “but the crowds have an appetite for it.  Many have tried over the last four years to claim the prize; none have succeeded. Some fatally so.”
 	
“The real kicker is that the credit pot grows each year,” said Imzi.
 	
“How much is it this year?” Andrew asked.
 	
Imzi looked at them both intently. “It’s grown to twenty-thousand credits.”
 	
Both Andrew and Dia’s jaws dropped.  
 	
“Twenty-thousand?” Dia asked in disbelief.
 	
Imzi nodded her head. 
 	
“First place is the easier win, especially for recognition.  But if we could even win that bonus prize, the credits alone would settle all our debts, and then some.”
 	
“Which is why we’ll be the ones to win it,” said one of the Red Angels standing at the bar counter.  She turned around, drink in hand, and leaned back against the counter, clearly not impressed by whom she was looking at.  Her sister did the same. “Why don’t you moof-milkers stick to what you’re good at?”
 	
Ledwin let out a low growl and clench his fists, then twisted to face them.
 	
“Why don't hotshots like you kriff off and race against someone in your own class?”
 	
“Tough talk coming from a dirtball Duros such as yourself,” said the second sister.  Ledwin was about to jump up from his seat when Imzi stopped him.  The second sister gave a laugh, and smirked as she took a drink from her mug.
 	
“Whaddya say we put those two in their places?” Andrew muttered to Dia as he leaned in close to her.
 	
“It’d be my pleasure,” she said, cracking her knuckles underneath the table.
 	
“Attention racers!” came a voice over the comm. “Track warm-up begins in ten minutes.  Report to your craft. Repeat, all racers report to your craft.”
 	
The Red Angels blew the four of them an insulting kiss, then began to file out of the room with the rest of the racers.
 	
As Andrew and Dia made their way to their Z-95s, she kept pace with him.
 	
“We should let them win, if possible,” she said loudly enough so that only he would hear. 
 	
“We can, if it comes to that,” he said, stopping her. “But we should also help them win the bonus prize if we can.”
 	
“You’d rather win the money than help them?”
 	
He stopped her, then stepped in front to face her.  
 	
“The way I see it, there’s no reason why we can’t win the prize money if we want to.  But if it comes down to it, we can help them win that bonus money.”
 	
“It’s suicide,” she said.
 	
“So is attacking a Star Destroyer. We’ve been through worse.”
 	
“I hope you’re right,” she said, turning to move towards the ladder to her Z-95. Grabbing onto the metal bars of the ladder and placing a foot on the first rung, she gave him one final look. “Because if you’re not, you’ll have many more favours to do for me before we depart this moon.”
