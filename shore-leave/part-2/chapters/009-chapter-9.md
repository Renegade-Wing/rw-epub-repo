Chapter 9
:::

Contessa Suli deChenzzi sat in her shaded seat on board the _SS Seahorse_. She had a perfect view of the race about to take place.  A handful of waiters and waitresses moved about the deck below her, serving the patrons who had also paid handsome credits to take the cruise and enjoy the special privileges afforded to them.  Her personal assistant sat to her right, scrolling through reports on a datapad that had been coming in all morning.  Most of them could wait, but there were a few that may need her attention should the need arise.
 	
Behind her, two security guards stood watch by the stairwell, screening the guests that were also making their way up to their private seats.  She also heard the distinct sound of Miguel’s boots as he padded his way towards her.
 	
“Really, Miguel,” she asked with a slightly irritated voice as he stopped in front of her, “is all this security necessary?”
 	
“If it were up to me, madam, yes.”
 	
She was about to respond to him when she saw Korwin Solari exit from his private seating location and make his way towards her.  Miguel noticed him as well, and turned to face her again.
 	
“Security can also be used to keep snakes where they belong.”
 	
“That will be all, Miguel.  Take your staff and wait at the bottom of the stairs.”
 	
Miguel gave a final disapproving glance at Solari, who had grown closer, and made his way towards the stairs.
 	
“Seela, dear,” she said, turning to her assistant. “I’m feeling a bit parched.  Would you mind fetching me something to drink?  A fruit cocktail with extra ice will do.”
 	
“Right away, ma’am,” said her assistant, moving out of her seat and down towards the stairwell.  
 	
“Hello, Korwin,” she said, looking up at him from her seat.  She tipped her shades down slightly to get a better look at him. “To what do I owe this … pleasure?”
 	
“The pleasure is all mine, my dear Suli,” he said, taking the seat her assistant had been occupying, and shifted to face her.  He was dressed in an all-white suit with a peach tie that disappeared into his peach vest.  A yellow rose sat nestled into his breast pocket.  He flashed her a roguish smile, which would have charmed almost any woman.  “I must say, you look particularly lovely on this sunny afternoon.”
 	
Removing her sunglasses and folding them in her hands, she flashed him a coy smile.
 	
“Flattery will get you nowhere today, Korwin.  Do you wish to have yet another discussion about a business proposition?  Or are you here for something more?”
 	
She watched as he gave a small laugh, looked down, then back up to her.  
 	
“Before a race begins?” he asked, giving a sigh and adjusting himself to sit back in his seat, his arms on the arm rests. “That would be in poor taste of such an exciting event to start the first day of our cruise together.  I merely wished to, as you might say, pop in and say hello.  It’s been some time since we’ve seen one another.”
 	
“Not long enough,” she said coolly.
 	
He paused long enough to give a conciliatory nod of his head, then turned to look back at her.
 	
“Please, my dear Suli, can we not put aside our differences for today?”
 	
She watched as the starfighters that had been modified into racers made their final approach to the docking module that  rose out of the water.  The last two craft, which were Z-95s, connected with their docking arms and shut their engines off, awaiting the instructions to launch.
 	
“Alright, Korwin,” she said, looking back at him. “If you want to play nice, I can too.  I’ll ask again -- to what do I owe this pleasure?”
 	
Solari gave a small sigh. “To simply ask if I’ll see you at tonight’s dinner gala.  I hear that the menu this year will be quite exquisite.  Perhaps I might even steal a dance or two?”
 	
She gave a soft chuckle. “For the price of the food, it had better be to everyone’s liking.  And you know,” she said as Seela returned with her drink, “that anyone who wishes to dance with me needs to earn it.”  Unfolding her sunglasses, she placed them back on her face, then took the drink from Seela’s hands.  She took a sip from the drink, the ice-cold beverage delivering an explosion of flavour to her tongue.
 	
“Then I hope,” Solari said, standing up to button his jacket in the front, “that I earn the pleasure of having a dance with you this evening.  Enjoy the race.”
 	
As he turned to leave, she withdrew the straw from her lips.
 	
“Korwin,” she called.  He stopped, and turned around to look at her once more. “How about a little wager?”
 	
He eyed her thoughtfully. “What did you have in mind?”
 	
“Nothing complicated, really.  Who do you think will win the race today?”
 	
“Before I give you my answer, I must ask what the wager will be,” he said. 
 	
“Ah ah,” she said, “answer my question first.”
 	
He paused for a moment before responding, studying her. “Why, the Red Angels of course.  Their Corsair-class racers are the fastest ones in the race.”
 	
“You sound so certain.”
 	
“I am,” he said coolly.  “They win every race they fly in.”
 	
“Almost every race,” she countered.  She took another sip of her drink, then met his gaze through her sunglasses. “I wager that those two new entrants in the race will be the winners.”
 	
He turned to glance at the Z-95s in the docking arms.
 	
“Those old clunkers?” he asked amusedly. “That is an interesting wager indeed.  And what, if I might ask, are we wagering for?”
 	
“If your Red Angels win, I’ll allow you to dine with me at my private table this evening,” she said, taking another sip of her drink. “And if I win … I want that yellow rose you’re wearing.”
 	
He looked down at the yellow rose, then back at her. 
 	
“A strange wager,” he said, stepping forward. “But one I can agree to.” He extended his hand, which she took and gave a firm handshake to.  As she let go, he gave a little bow. “Enjoy the show,” he said, then left to return to his own booth.
 	
“Is everything alright, ma’am?” asked Seela as she sat back down.
 	
“Yes, Seela dear,” she said. “I think everything will be just fine.”
 	

    “Ladies and gentlemen, beings of all ages,” boomed a voice over the speaker system across the ship. “The crew of the _SS Starfish_
    would like to welcome you aboard for the first day of our famous cruise.  To celebrate all of our esteemed guests, you are invited to watch the racers of the Contessa’s Cup, the premier race of the _Starfire Circuit_
    .”
 	
Cheers and claps rose from among the patrons below her.
 	
“Before we begin, we’d like to introduce you to our racers before they speed away to earn the top prize of ten-thousand credits.  In first and second place are the sector-famous twin sister duo, the Rrrrreeeeed Angeeelllllsss!”
 	
The faces and impressive stats of the sisters appeared on the holo projectors around the ship.  A roar of cheers could be heard from all corners of the ship, clearly indicating that they were a fan favourite.  The announcer continued to go through the roster of pilots and their seconds while the stats flashed across the holo projectors.

“In ninth and tenth place, we have fan-favourites Ledwin Kes and Imzi Noan.” A few cheers rose up from below, though not nearly as many as the previous racers. “And in eleventh and twelfth place we have some last-minute entries.” Murmurs rose from the crowd below. Suli couldn’t help but feel a wave of uneasiness wash over her, though she tried to stay focused on the announcer. “All the way from the New Republic navy and serving aboard the _CRS Vigilant_, Major Andrew Dobson and Captain Diaaaaa Taannn!”
 	
As their profile pictures flashed onto the holo vids, claps arose from a handful of patrons below.  Clearly there was little enthusiasm for newcomers, especially those who were serving in the military.
 	
“We’d also like to remind our patrons,” continued the announcer, “that should any of the racers decide to pursue the Solari Star after the race has finished, the prize this year is twenty-thousand credits.”  A ripple of excitement and gasps ran through the patrons below, and the crowds that had gathered along the deck railings of the ship.  “And with that,” continued the announcer, “we’ll get underway.  Racers -- start your engines!”
 	
As the engines on the racing crafts flickered to life, Suli sat back in her seat and took another sip of her drink, her free hand firmly gripping the arm of her chair.  Anything could happen in this race.  She only hoped that it wouldn’t be deadly.

Andrew sat in the cockpit of his Z-95, systems reading green.  He waited tensely for the lights ahead of him to turn green, anticipating the drop his craft would make when the arms let go of his racer’s frame.  To his left was Dia, who gave him a nod and a thumbs up.  Past her he could just make out Imzi in the cockpit of her T-wing, looking nervous and tense.
 	
“Racers, on your marks,” came the voice over the intercom.  The lights remained red on the signal device. “Get set.” They slid to a yellow color. “Go!”  As the lights turned green, the docking clamps began to release their ships. “And they’re off!”
 	
All except Andrew’s. 
 	
“What the kriffing--?” he began.
 	
As the other racers dropped several meters below, their engines ignited to full.  Dia shot ahead, leaving him sitting there in his docking clamps.  Then, without warning, they released.  His stomach lurched as he was unprepared for the late release.  Shooting an arm out, he engaged his throttle, and his Z-95 accelerated.  He was in last place.
 	
“Great way to start the race,” he mumbled as he chased after his opponents.
 	
“Do try to keep up, dear,” said Dia as she overtook Imzi’s T-wing. 
 	
“Yeah, yeah,” he replied, shifting more power to his engines.  As his craft picked up speed, the group began to approach the first ring.  They mostly passed through it in order of release, save for a few who had managed to slide ahead of their opponents.

:::

Aboard the _SS Starfish_, the crowd cheered as the announcer gave play-by-play calls. 
 	
“And in first and second place respectively are the Red Angels!” he called as a roar of applause rose up from the crowd. “Bin Kin-Moor and Hakari Onaka take third and fourth,” he went on until he reached the end. “And it’s Imzi Noan and Andrew Dobson in eleventh and twelfth place.  They’ll really have to up their game if they want to win this race!”

:::{.chapter-internal-break .center-text}
>\***\
:::
 	
As he spun through the second ring and cut to the right, Andrew glanced at his engine meter.  He was building up enough energy that he could perform a drift or two if needed, or accelerate his speed to close the distance between some of the other racers.  A few in front had, in fact, decided to do so before they got to the third ring.  Two racers nearly collided as they went through, but managed to somehow avoid each other as they made a sharp turn left towards the fourth ring.


:::{.chapter-internal-break .center-text}
>\***\
:::

 	
“Ooh!” called the announcer. “A near-collision there, folks, but things are rapidly changing for the racers.  The Red Angels still maintain the lead; Onaka is in third; Dia Tann has just taken seventh place!”



:::{.chapter-internal-break .center-text}
>\***\
:::

 	
“Can’t you go any faster?” Dia called over the comm to Andrew.
 	
“You don’t think I’m trying?” he shot back as he did a barrel roll with the other racers and cleared the fourth ring.  As soon as he did, he hit his boost.  His Z-95 surged forward, and he overtook Noan.  Ledwin was ahead of him now, and Andrew pulled up beside him.  He shot a quick glance over at Ledwin, who was trying to gauge the distance ahead while keeping Andrew in his sights.
 	
“Pull back,” he heard Ledwin say over the headset. “We both won’t make it through.”
 	
Sure enough, the sixth ring was quickly approaching -- and it was much smaller than the other ones.
 	
As the racers began to line up and fly through one-by-one, Andrew glanced behind him to see Imzi hot on Ledwin’s tail.  If he pulled back, he’d lose two spots of lead; but if he didn’t, he would fatally risk his life and Ledwin’s.
 	
Cutting his throttle slightly, he let his Z-95 fall back behind Imzi’s T-wing.  Unlike Imzi and Ledwin, however, he had been watching the racers ahead more carefully, and had noticed them begin to dive down as they cleared the ring.  
 	
He flipped his craft over one-hundred-and-eighty degrees.  As soon as he entered the ring, he put full power to his engines, pulled the stick back as hard as he could, and engaged his boost once more.  He shot past Imzi and Ledwin, and managed to get past another race before his boost ran out.  He was nearly behind Dia at this point.
 	
“About time you showed up,” she said to him.
 	
“Figured I shouldn’t keep you waiting any longer,” he said as they leveled their crafts out.


:::{.chapter-internal-break .center-text}

:::
 	
 	
“I don’t believe it!” cried the announcer over the loudspeakers. “Dobson takes eighth place with an incredible maneuver!”  Cheers and gasps rose up from the crowd, as well as some applause.


:::{.chapter-internal-break .center-text}

Korwin Solari watched with great interest from his seat.  There were only a few more rings to go before the first lap would be complete.  The Red Angels were still poised to win, and easily held a lead from the others.  Still, with how some of the other racers were performing, he wanted to secure a win.  He leaned over to his attendant, and whispered a set of instructions.  His attendant nodded, and she left to make her way to the stairwell.  The Contessa took note of her as she left, then refocused her attention on the race.


:::{.chapter-internal-break .center-text}

“Ninth ring coming up,” said Dia as they leveled themselves off once more. “Get ready to break left as soon as we pass.  If we boost, we can gain some distance on sixth and seventh place.”
 	
“Copy that,” said Andrew, his military training kicking into gear.  As they cleared the ninth ring, they cut their craft left and hit their boosts in tandem, closing the distance between the pair ahead of them. “Fall in behind them; let’s ride their slipstream until we pass the next ring.”
 	
“You read my mind,” Dia said as they slipped in behind the two racers.  It was smooth sailing through the tenth ring, which afforded them the ability to easily slip ahead of the two racers they were pursuing.  To their surprise, Ledwin and Imzi had managed to stay on Andrew’s tail.
 	
“Don’t think you can leave us behind,” he heard Ledwin say as the two T-wings slid in behind them.  As they passed through the tenth ring, Imzi’s T-wing shot past them all rather quickly, and fell into the lead ahead of Dia.  She had clearly been saving most of her boost, using the T-wing’s natural speed to take up most of the race until now.
 	
“You snooze, you lose,” they heard Imzi say smugly over the radio.
 	
“So that’s how you wanna play, is it?” Dia said. “Remember, it takes two to tango!”
 	
Dia flipped her Z-95 into a roll and shot forward with a boost, sliding in front of Imzi to enter the eleventh ring ahead of them.
 	
“Showoff,” Andrew said with a smirk as they began to clear the eleventh ring.
 	
As the racers leveled off once more, they began their approach to the twelfth and final ring.  After that, it would only be two more laps through the same circuit.  The racers ahead were just about to pass through the twelfth ring when the lights activated on it.  A swirl of energy shot forward, producing a ribbon of energy that spiraled forward.  The Red Angels were able to anticipate the sudden change quickly and maneuvered to match the spiral shape of the energy field.  
 	
The R-41 Starchaser behind them wasn’t so lucky.
 	
One if its wings clipped the energy beam, shredding it to pieces.  As the craft slid to its side due to the impact, its nose struck another part of the energy beam.  The craft spun out of control, smoke and flames protruding from its body, and hit the ocean below in a splash of water.  The racers behind it broke off all together, forced to loop around to the rear of the racing line.
 	
“Everyone barrel roll, now!” barked Dia as she put her Z-95 into a spin, narrowly threading the ribbon of energy.  Miraculously, they all cleared it.
 	
“What the kriff was that?” Andrew asked as he finished his corkscrew.  The second lap had begun.
 	
“Someone’s activated the advanced flying concourse,” Ledwin said through gritted teeth over the comm. Ahead, more and more rings began to activate.  “The organizers need to stop the race!”
 	

    ”_Starfish_
    Bridge, this is Red Angel One,” came a new voice over the comm. “Request you stop the race immediately.  Repeat, stop the race immediately.”
 	
Static filled the airwaves.
 	
“They’re not responding,” said another pilot. “What do we do?”
 	
“The only thing we can do,” said Red Angel Two as they approached the second ring and its energy ribbon. “Race.”


:::{.chapter-internal-break .center-text}
>\***\
:::

 	
Suli deChenzzi leapt out of her seat as a second racer clipped part of a ring and its energy ribbon.  She grabbed the metal handrail in front of her, watching as the racer spun out of control and hit the water. 
 	
“No,” she said to herself. “This can’t be happening.  Shouldn’t be happening.”  Whipping around to look at her assistant, a look of horror on her face as well, she began giving orders. “Steela!  Contact the bridge.  Tell them to shut the race down.  Shut it down now before anyone else gets hurt!”
 	
Steela leapt out of her seat, comm unit in hand, and tried several times to connect with the bridge.
 	
“I can’t, ma’am,” she said, her eyes wide. “Someone is jamming the signal.”
 	
“Then get going, girl!  Run to the bridge if you have to. I want this race stopped.  And dispatch all the medical teams!” she called as Seela bolted towards the stairwell.
 	
Turning her gaze to Korwin Solari, she noticed that his assistant had returned and was handing him a drink.  She watched as Korwin met her gaze, and could just make out a faint smile on his face.  He sat with one leg crossed on top of the other, raised his glass and nodded an acknowledgement to her.  As she heard another explosion, she turned to see one of the T-wings spinning towards the water.  Turning back to Korwin, she swore she saw him feign surprise and shock as the craft hit the water.  As the crowd reacted in excitement and horror, Suli gripped the railing until her knuckles turned white, a knot of dread and disgust rising in her stomach and chest.  
 	
Someone had to put a stop to this madness before it was too late.



:::{.chapter-internal-break .center-text}

“Imzi!” Ledwin cried as he watched her T-wing spin downwards and into the water.
 	
“She’s okay!” Andrew called as leveled off his craft and looked down to where she had landed.  The canopy was opening, Imzi bailing out and swimming away from her craft.  Rescue ships had begun to fly out to collect the crashed racers and their pilots. “She got clear.”  He heard Ledwin give a sigh of relief.
 	
As they approached the next ring, the energy ribbon would force them to pick a side.  If they went left, they’d be on the inside track. But if they went right, it would put them on the outside curve, ultimately causing them to fall behind the others.
 	
“Left,” called Dia. “Go left!”  They did so, keeping pace with the other racers but giving each other enough room to maneuver.
 	
“No prize money is worth this madness,” called another racer over the comm.  “I’m dropping out.”  Two others agreed, and the three racers broke off and made their way back to the hangar of the cruise ship.
 	
“How many more rings?” asked Andrew as he did a somersault with his craft as he cleared the left turn.
 	
“Two more to go,” said Dia.
 	
“Any idea what circuit three involves, Ledwin?” Andrew asked.
 	
“What would you say if I told you ion cannons and mines?” he asked.
 	
“That I probably shouldn’t have asked that question,” Andrew said.
 	
“Ditto,” Dia chimed in.
 	
They cleared the eleventh ring with modest difficulty.  The Red Angels raced ahead.  This time, however, the problem was more difficult.
 	
The twelfth ring had a shield protecting the front.  A gold light lit the top of the ring.  They watched as the first Red Angel fired three ion laser blasts, hitting the gold light squarely.  The shield dropped just long enough for the first one to pass through.  The second Red Angel wasn’t so lucky.  Her shots missed, and she was forced to swerve away at the last second.  This would force her to loop around and fall behind the other racers unless she was quick.
 	
“Hit the target and boost as soon as you’re through,” said Ledwin.
 	
Dia was the first to fire, then Andrew.  Their ion shots hit the gold light, leaving the shield open just long enough for them to pass through and boost towards the first ring of the third circuit.  Ledwin and the remaining racers did the same.
 	
As they approached the first ring again, Andrew noticed that the energy fields had changed.  Two ion turrets had extended from the sides of the ring. Blue bolts of energy began racing towards them.  The racer in front of Dia was not prepared for being tracked after the first Red Angel had made her way through the ring, and took several direct hits.
 	
As the racer’s shields and systems failed, it began to plummet towards the ocean, and was only able to recover at the last second, narrowly missing the waves in the ocean.
 	
“Watch out for the mines,” called Dia as Andrew spun to avoid a direct laser blast and rocketed through the first ring.  Sure enough, four mines had begun to detach from the outer layer of the ring.  When they were several meters away, another round of ion blasts lanced out towards the racers, this time picking individual targets.
 	
“Shoot them down if you can,” called Ledwin. “There’s nothing in the rules about penalties for shooting the mines.”
 	
“The only problem is,” said Dia as she fired off a few shots at one of the mines, “is that it draws you off course, and you have to line yourself up for a straight shot.  It’s doable, but risky.”  The mine fizzled with electric blue energy, temporarily disabled.
 	
“We may not have a choice,” Andrew said. “Depends on what the rings ahead have in store for us.”
 	
As they cleared the second ring, the third ring had a shield that was active for a few seconds, then dissipated.  
 	
“Are you kidding me?!” he exclaimed, seeing the shield flash on and off.
 	
“Not kidding,” Dia said. “Watch your interval; break off if you can’t make it.”
 	
They did make it, but just barely.  Ledwin managed to pass just as the shield began to close.  The two racers behind him had to break off and try again.
 	
It was just the four of them now.  The Red Angel in the lead, Dia second, with Andrew and Ledwin in third and fourth respectively.
 	
The next few rings only had partial shields covering half of the interior, which made for an extra tight fit.  As the Red Angel’s F8A Corsair narrowly slid through the ring, ion cannons on the opposite side began to track her.  She had just begun to boost when a shot connected with one of her engines.  Her craft faltered for a few seconds, before it shot forward towards the next half-protected ring with mines.  But it was just enough to significantly close the gap between the four racers.

:::


 	
“I don’t believe it, folks!” cried the announcer. “Red Angel One’s error has cost her; the four racers are within easy reach of one another.  With half a lap to go, it could be anyone’s race!”
 	
Cheers rose from the swelling crowds and patrons, eager to see who would win despite the danger.
 	
She felt a figure grab onto the railing to her right. It was Solari.
 	
“Quiet the race, isn’t it?” he mused, his drink in hand.
 	
“Korwin,” spat Suli as she watched the racers make their way through the course and rings. “Did you have anything to do with this?”
 	
“My dear Suli,” he said, turning to lean against the railing. “I assure you I had nothing to do with any of this.  But it has certainly made for an interesting afternoon.  It looks like I may get that private dinner after all,” he said, flashing a smile.
 	
“Don’t be so sure,” she scowled.  Just then a gasp erupted from the crowd.  One of the Z-95s had clipped the shield of the eighth ring.  One of its engines on fire, it spun briefly towards the sea before being able to recover.  Suli let out a sigh of relief as the pilot had regained control.  “But if I do find out you had anything to do with this,” she said, turning to face Korwin, a tentacled appendage making as if to wrap itself around him, “there won’t be a place in this star system that you can hide from me.”
 	
He gave a curt laugh, and gestured to the patrons below.  Several of them were looking up at the pair. 
 	
“Making threats now, Suli?  How unlike you.  I would have expected you to be more … sensible.”
 	
Looking down to the patrons below, she retracted her appendage and scowled at Korwin.

“I’m hit!” cried Dia as her craft spun towards the ocean.
 	
“Dia!” Andrew yelled as flames erupted from one of her engines.  He tried to track her as she fell seaward, but couldn’t do that and keep his attention on the course. “Are you all right?” he asked eagerly.
 	
“DANK FERRICK!” he heard her curse into the headset. “Yeah, I’ll make it.  But it’s all up to you now.”
 	
As Ledwin pulled up next to Andrew, he fired several shots at the mines ahead.  All scored direct hits, clearing a path for them.
 	
“Two rings to go,” Ledwin said.  “At least I’ll make third.”
 	
Something stirred inside of Andrew.  He still wanted to win, but having Ledwin win third just wouldn’t sit right with him.
 	
“Hey Ledwin,” he said as they approached the eleventh ring. “How’d you like to finish better than third?”
 	
“What do you mean?” asked Ledwin.
 	
“I mean, let’s stick it to that Red Angel. Blast and fast style. Are you with me?”
 	
They cleared the eleventh ring.  One more to go.  He saw the ribbon of energy begin to form, creating a double-barrier that looked and acted almost like a slide.
 	
“Blast and fast?” Ledwin asked.
 	
“Something stupid that might work.  Follow my lead onto the shield, and boost when I tell you.”
 	
“O-okay,” said Ledwin apprehensively.
 	
Closing the gap on the Red Angel, who had to slow down just enough to make the curved turn, Andrew rotated ninety degrees and guided his Z-95 towards the shield.  It connected, his craft bouncing gently.  Energy rippled as the craft glided along the shield.  Ledwin did the same, though a bit more awkwardly with the T-wing’s design.
 	
“Get ready,” Andrew said as they approached the curve. “Boost now!”
 	
As the engines roared to full power, the Z-95 and T-wing shot forward along the curve.  It took all his strength to keep the ship steady.  Both he and Ledwin had enough momentum and speed that the curve acted like a slingshot and sent them propelling forward.  Andrew looked up just in time to see the pilot of Red Angel One gasp in surprise from her cockpit at the sudden move.  
 	
“Pull up ... now!” said Andrew as he and Ledwin raced past the F8A Corsair.  They both pulled up … and blasted through the final ring. “Now that’s how you do a blast and fast!” he hooted.”

“I DON’T BELIEVE IT!!” roared the announcer. The crowd lost their minds in excitement and cheering.  “A daring move by both Dobson and Kes literally propels them into first and second place!!  The Red Angels finish third for the first time in their racing history.  This will be a major upset for them, folks!”
 	
Suli glanced to look at Korwin’s face.  She could almost make out what she thought was an eye twitch.  He stood there in shock.
 	
“Looks like I win,” she said, plucking the yellow rose from his blazer pocket.  Korwin stared at her as she took a long smell from the rose, enjoying its intoxicating fragrance.
 	
“Yes,” Korwin said, recomposing himself. “Yes, you did. A race well run.”
 	
“Especially for a race that was sabotaged.”
 	
Solari remained silent as Miguel finished climbing the stairs, making his way towards her.
 	
“Ma’am,” said Miguel, stopping next to her.  “We’ve found something that may interest you.” He handed her a black disc-like object, the size of a small dinner plate.  It had a bulbous lens for an eye, a short antenna that jutted from its head, and four small mechanical arms that hung limply from its body.
 	
“What’s this?” she asked.
 	
“It’s an ID9 Seeker Droid, ma’am.  Most likely an Imperial design, though it has no official markings or codes.  We found it in an inconspicuous area near the bridge.  Put up quite the fight before we were able to disable it.  We believe this is what caused the communication error.”
 	
She turned the droid over in her hands, examining its lifeless body.  Her thoughts were interrupted by the announcer.
 	
“I don’t believe it, folks!” called the announcer. “Dobson and Kes are making their way towards the Solari Star!”  Murmurs and gasps rose from the crowd. “No one has won the Solari Star in four years, but we’ll soon see if luck is about to change.”
 	
“I want a full investigation, Chief,” she said, handing the droid back to Miguel. “Go over all the security feeds. Question any witnesses that may have seen something.  But do so discreetly.”
 	
“Yes, ma’am,” he said, nodding.  Pivoting around, he made to leave for the stairs.
 	
“I suppose I’m off the hook then?” asked Korwin, giving her a glance.
 	
“Time will tell,” Suli replied, eying him carefully.
 	
“I’d be very interested to see what your Chief of Security reports, then.  If he finds anything.”
 	
Suli refrained from responding, turning back to watch the Z-95 and T-wing approach the star-shaped island.
 	
“How about another wager?” he asked after a moment.
 	
She wasn’t in the mood for any more games, but decided to play along to appease him and keep up a good appearance.
 	
“What did you have in mind?” she asked coolly.
 	
“If the Duros pilot wins the Solari Star, you’ll dance with me tonight at the gala.”
 	
“And if the New Republic pilot wins?” she asked.
 	
“Well … I’ll leave that part of the wager up to you.”
 	
She thought carefully.  It was doubtful that she would get any more information out of him for the time being.  But there was a way to sweeten the pot.
 	
“Alright, Solari. If the New Republic pilot wins, you need to make a donation to my charity foundation. Fifteen thousand credits.”
 	
“Fifteen thousand credits?” he asked, eying her.  
 	
“It’s for a good cause,” she said flatly. “You are a gentleman after all, aren’t you?”
 	
“That I am,” he said, extending his hand. “It’s a deal.”
 	
She shook to seal the pact, Seela being the silent witness.

“I-I can’t believe it,” said Ledwin as they shot through the final ring.  “We won.  We won!”
 	
“That we did,” said Andrew with a chuckle.  Then, without missing a beat, “Are you up for the Solari Star?”
 	
Dia’s voice cut over the intercom.
 	
“You nerfherder,” she said. “After what we just went through?  Are you crazy?”
 	
“I might be,” he said, shrugging his shoulders to himself. “But I’m feeling lucky.  How about you, Ledwin?”
 	
“Yeah,” said Ledwin after a few seconds. “Let’s do it.”
 	
“If you don’t make it,” said Dia, “I’ll kill you.”
 	
“I’m sure you will, dear, if the ion cannons don’t.  Dobson out.”
 	
With that, the two racers surged forward to Star Island ahead of them.  It wasn’t long before the first cliff loomed into view.
 	
“Keep and eye out for those cannons and mines,” Andrew said as he saw the obstacles begin to activate.  Blue lasers shot towards them.
 	
“You don’t have to tell me twice,” Ledwin said, matching his speed with Andrew.
 	
The two racers rolled and dove towards the first cliff outcropping.  They leveled off about two-hundred meters from the sea below them, and raced towards the first ring.  They cleared it with ease.
 	
“That’s one,” Andrew said as they angled towards the second cliff.  This time the mines began to move up and down or from side-to-side, the lasers becoming more erratic but deadlier.  Two shots almost stripped away Andrew’s shields, but he dumped his laser energy to shields to compensate for the loss.
 	
“That’s two,” said Ledwin as they cleared the second ring.  
 	
Each approach became more and more complex.  At one point between the third and fourth ring, Andrew was almost disabled entirely.  Had he been so, the rescue crews would have been scraping his body and ship off the jagged rocks below for at least a week.
 	
“That’s four,” said Andrew as they cleared the fourth marker.  “Get ready to break for the mountain summit as soon as we clear the fifth.
 	
When they reached the fifth, a shield rose up over the opening.  Out of lasers, Andrew let Ledwin take the lead.  He shot a series of ion blasts at the shield, weakening it until it disappeared.   
	
The two racers shot through the opening, cutting right sharply.  Andrew re-took the lead, with Ledwin close on his six.  Mines and laser placements rose up from the trees below, opening fire on the approaching ships.  The two fighters wove through the oncoming fire, racing up the mountainside as fast as they could.  They could just make out the summit when the warning system activated in Andrew’s Z-95.
 	
“What that--?”
 	
“Ion missiles,” called Ledwin as a pair streaked from the mountainside towards them.
 	
“Are they part of the defenses?” Andrew asked.
 	
“They’re not supposed to be,” Ledwin said. “If we break, we lose the chance to win.”
 	
“I might,” Andrew said, shooting past Ledwin, “but you won’t.”
 	
“What are you--?”
 	
“JUST GO!” Andrew called.
 	
A second later, the two ion missiles connected with his Z-95, sending it spiraling to the treeline below.
 	
Ledwin hit the boost on his craft, rocketing it forward.
 	
Andrew madly pressed the buttons in his cockpit, hoping to re-activate the engines in time. 
 	
“Come on, you hunk of junk,” he said, furiously smashing his ignition button. “Come on, come on, come on.” The trees loomed dangerously closer.
 	
As Ledwin cleared the summit ridge, his T-wing shot through the marker on the top of the mountain with two seconds to spare.
 	
And as he did so, Andrew’s engines re-ignited.  Pulling back as hard as he could and setting his throttle to full, his Z-95 just managed to clear the treeline, brushing the tops of several trees.
 	
“Oh my gosh,” Ledwin said in disbelief, sinking back in his seat. “I did it.”  Tears began to well in his eyes. “I did it. I really did it.”
 	
“That you did,” crackled Andrew’s voice over the radio.  “Now let’s head home.  We have a victory flyby to do.”

Below them on the ship, the spectators were going wild.  Holographic images of Ledwin Kes flashed to life around the ship, declaring him the winner of the Solari Star.  Both Suli and Korwin’s jaws dropped.
 	
“Looks like I get that dance after all,” he said, shifting to look at her.
 	
“Yes, you do,” she said, after a moment.  “And it looks like you’re out twenty-thousand credits.”
 	
He flashed her a roguish smile.
 	
“A small price to pay, for a dance with a beautiful woman,” he said. “Enjoy the rest of your afternoon.”
 	
“Korwin,” she called as he walked away.
 	
“Yes?”
 	
“Did you know Ledwin would win?”
 	
He waited until the two racers had rocketed by, their canopies tipped to the crowds below to wave, to reply.  As the crowds roared with fanfare and chanted Ledwin’s name over and over, he had to raise his voice so she could hear him.
 	
“I didn’t,” he said. “But no matter the outcome, I always win in the end.”  And with that, he walked away.
 	
“That you do, Korwin,” she said to herself as she watched him. “As do I.”

When they landed in the hangar, they were met by the small crowd of mechanics and the other racers -- all save the Red Angel sisters, who were standing by their crafts, scowling for having been knocked down to third place.
 	
As Ledwin descended the ladder that had been hooked to his craft, his pit crew clapped him on the back and congratulated him.  Imzi broke through the crowd and ran towards him.
 	
“You did it!” she cried, hugging him. Tears shone in her round eyes. “You really did it!”
 	
“No,” he said, putting her down on the ground and taking her hands.  “We did it.”
 	
Andrew circled around the T-wing and joined the duo as the crowd began to circle around them.
 	
“Major,” Ledwin said, extending his hand. “I don’t know how to thank you.  Because of you and your partner, we finally have a shot at the big races.  The credits we won today … well, they’ll really help us out.”
 	
“No trouble at all, Ledwin,” Andrew said, shaking his hand. “I hope that you and Imzi achieve your dreams some day.”
 	
“We will,” said Ledwin as his crew members and some mechanics hoisted him and Imzi up over their shoulders and began to lead them away.  From somewhere in the crowd, a champagne bottle popped and white foam began to spray them. “You can count on it,” Ledwin said, laughing with Imzi as they were carried away.
 	
Dia was the only one left standing several meters away from him when the crowd cleared.  Andrew hadn’t immediately noticed her in the crowd.
 	
“Uh, hi,” he said hesitantly.
 	
She began to take slow, measured steps towards him.
 	
“You know,” she began slowly, her words keeping pacing with her steps. Her hands were hooked into her flight suit pockets. “It’s a good thing that no one was seriously injured today. It could have been a lot worse.”
 	
“Yeah,” he said as she moved closer.
 	
“I saw the whole thing on the holo projector after I landed,” she said. “That was quite a move you pulled at the finish line. Ingenious even.”  As she made her last step in front of him, she took hold of his flight suit collar with her left hand, pushing him gently back against the frame of the T-wing.
 	
“Uh, thanks,” he said, blushing slightly.
 	
“And you helped Ledwin and Imzi take second place,” she said, leaning up towards his face, her mouth stopping near hers.  He could feel her warm, sweet breath roll over his face. “Not to mention letting him win the Solari Star.  Well,” she said, lowering her voice, “that was pretty sweet.” Her warm lips connected with his, and he was lost in the moment.
 	
As she pulled away a few seconds later, she flashed him a teasing smile -- then sucker punched him as hard as she could in the gut.  He gave out a cry of surprise, the wind rushing out of his lungs, and as she let go of him he collapsed to his knees on the deck plating.
 	
“Taking those two ion missiles in a Z-95, on the other hand, was possibly the stupidest thing you have done to date.  Do that again, and I’ll kill you for real.”
 	
He sat there, gasping for breath.
 	
“Come on, you half-witted nerf herder,” she said, turning to walk away. “You owe me a foot rub. And some chocolates.”
 	
“Yes, dear,” he finally croaked, standing up to follow her.
