[Day 3]
:::

 	
He awoke to the sound of chirping.  And something poking at him.  BD-B2 stood on his pillow, poking him in the face.
 	
“Alright,” Andrew mumbled into his pillow.  “Alright, I’m awake.”  It took three more pokes from the droid before he rolled over and tried to swat the little droid, though he missed by a mile.  The droid tittered and scurried off the bed and out the door.  Looking out the window, he could see the sun was in the throes of rising for the day.  Checking his chronometer, the time read just after 6:30 in the morning.
 	
“Kriffing droid,” he mumbled, rubbing his eyes.  Fumbling for the bath robe he had found the previous day, he wrapped it around himself and made his way for the bathroom.  
 	
As he checked his appearance in the mirror, the light blinded him until was able to focus.  He had bags under his eyes despite having somehow slept for several hours.  He sighed, and grabbed a cup from the counter to take a quick drink of water from the tap.  As the water ran, he could make out the sound of bare footsteps making their way into the room.  Dia appeared, with a switched-off BD-B2 in her hands.
 	
“For once,” she mumbled as she entered the room, “I want to disassemble the little bugger.”  She reached for the light switch and flicked it off, most likely because the bright lights were hurting her eyes, and then tossed the droid onto the top of the hamper just inside the door. 
 	
“Good morning,” he said quietly, turning to meet her.  There was just enough light spilling in from the hallway that he could see her.  She, too, had her bathrobe on, though loosely.  Burying her head into his chest, she wrapped her arms around him.  He held her, neither one of them moving.
 	
“My kriffing head,” she said tiredly after a few seconds. “How much did I have to drink last night?”
 	
“A glass-and-a-half,” he said, kissing her head. “After that, who knows?”
 	
“Oh. Right,” she said, then heaved a sigh of exhaustion. “Did you enjoy last night?”
 	
“I think we both did,” he said, squeezing her. 
 	
“Good,” she mumbled. “If I wasn’t so hung-over and exhausted, I would pull you into that shower right now,” she said, turning her head to the side and squeezing him harder. “But I’m going to take some medicine and go back to bed.  Don’t wake me until breakfast is ready.”  
 	
“Why do I have to do all the cooking?” he asked her.
 	
“Because,” she said, stepping back to look at him. “You’re so kriffing wonderful at it.  And I’m going to need a kriffing wonderful breakfast to get through today.”
 	
“Alright,” he said, rubbing her arms. “I’ll see what I can do.  Just give me time to get ready.”
 	
“Cool,” she said, giving him a kiss. She then reached beside him to open a drawer and pulled out a bottle of headache medicine. “I’ll be down later.”
 	
With that, she left the room.
 	
Half-an-hour later he was dressed and made his way downstairs, more alert from the shower but still groggy. 
 	
He surveyed the living room.  The box of chocolates was empty, as was the wine glass she had been using to drink from.  The wine bottle was, in fact, empty as well.  He found that laying on its side next to the coffee table, along with her beach orange beach dress.
 	
Rummaging around the kitchen, trying to not make too much noise, he scrounged up what he could for breakfast.  He was able to find some eggs and cheese -- a cheddar of some sort -- to make scrambled eggs with.  That, combined with some oatmeal, still-fresh fruit, and bacon made the main dish of their breakfast.  He was also able to brew up some good-quality caff to go along with the meal.  Setting the table, he added the dirty cookware to the growing pile from the night before.  He thought about going up to get her, but decided against it.  She did need some solid sleep after last night.  
 	
Instead, he sat down on the couch, intending to close his eyes for just a few minutes.  To his surprise, she was the one standing over him an hour later as he lay curled up on the couch.  This time she was wearing a white floral sundress with an array of sunflowers on it.  
 	
“Good morning, sleepyhead,” she said, gently rubbing his cheek and hair.
 	
“Ohmigosh,” he said, sitting up. “What time is it?”
 	
“Still early.  I put the food in the re-heater. Come, eat.”
 	
The sun spilled in through the kitchen window and glass door to the deck, providing further warmth to the kitchen.  The food wasn’t as fresh as he would have liked, but there were no complaints from her.  They mostly ate in silence, save for her praise of the meal and caff.  Then came the dishes, which they worked through quickly together.
 	
“Okay,” he said as he put the last plate away. “What’s the agenda for today?”
 	
“Today is the first day of the cruise ship, so we’ll need to be ready to leave by ten.  Boarding begins at ten-thirty.  We can call a shuttle cab, which will take us to the main dock.  You’re easy to pack for, but I’ll need help.”
 	
“We’re going on a cruise for a few days,” he said. “How much could you possibly need?”
 	
“Let’s see: I need some everyday clothing.  Then some beachwear for tanning and possibly the pool if it isn’t too crowded. Then there’s clothing for dancing, clothing in case it gets cold. Oh, and clothing for the Contessa’s Cup race.”
 	
“How could I forget?” he said, shrugging.
 	
“Then there’s my shoes, make-up, and anything ancillary that I think I need to bring.”
 	
“Dia,” he said, walking over to her and rubbing her bare arms, “we’re going on a cruise. Not a military campaign.”
 	
“On the contrary,” she said, poking him pointedly in the chest with a finger. “We’re going on a cruise, and it’s a jungle out there.  A lady needs to be prepared for every scenario.”
 	
“Of course,” he said with a sigh. “How could I forget?”

A little over an hour later they found themselves down at the loading docks.  Andrew and the butler droid that came with the ferrying service struggled to drag the several suitcases that Dia and he had packed, while she moved ahead in her dress, carrying nothing but her white purse.  And, he had discovered, the executive membership card that that woman had given him days prior.
 	
As they boarded the transport, several passengers gave them looks as they carried and stored the bags in the compartments.
 	
Taking their seats, they waited only a few more minutes before the shuttle lifted off and took them to their destination.
 	
With the cruise ship not being overly far from the port, it wasn’t long before they hand landed in the main hangar at the rear of the ship.  The hangar was almost large enough to rival a Mon Calamari cruiser.  Several other transports were landing or taking off, and rows of crates full of supplies lined the hanger while the work crew scurried to and fro, making preparations or retrieving what they needed.  On the far end of the hangar sat several starfighter models, which were a mix of T-wings, R-41 Starchasers, and Z-95 Headhunters.  Maintenance crews were working on them, while several racing circuit pilots either worked with their crews or gave orders.  He also happened to notice two identical ships that were designed for what must have been top-tier racing.
 	
“Woah,” Andrew said, stopping to look at the two pristine racers. “Are those Vaught-Krynex F8A Corsair racers?”
 	
“Sure are,” Dia said, pointing to the red-colored bodies of the ships. He let out a low whistle.
 	
“Someone’s got some credits.  Any idea which ones we’ll get?” Andrew asked as he continued pushing their luggage on an air cart across the hangar.
 	
“New and first-time racers typically get the Z-95s, while the senior racers get the other ships depending on their skill and ability,” she said.
 	
“Then it’s a good thing the layout for the Z-95 is similar to an X-wing,” he said, “otherwise we might have a literal crash course in how to fly them.”
 	
She gave him an incredulous smile at his joke.
 	
“What?” he said as they entered the elevator.

After some maneuvering the throngs of cruiser goers moving up and down the deck hallways, they were finally able to find their room.  
 	
“This is the guest suite?” he asked, his jaw dropping at how spacious and glamorous the room was.  
 	
“Oh, this is nothing compared to the patron suites,” she said, tossing her sun hat onto the nearest queen-sized bed.  She then began to unpack the first of her suitcases, hanging the dresses she had brought into the walk-in closet on the other side of the room.
 	
“We could live here,” he said, running his hand over the smooth and ornately designed chairs near the dining table.
 	
“You’d be out of credits within the month,” she said, flashing a smile from the closet.  In her hand was the gold-colored executive membership card. “And I don’t think you would want to burn through this either to do so.”
 	
“No,” he said, pacing around the room to admire the layout and the rest of the furniture.  His eye caught an envelope with cursive writing addressed to the both of them that was nestled into the stand by the holovid display. He flipped it over to see a burgundy wax seal had sealed the backside.  The seal had an intricately designed coat of arms with a large ‘C’ in the center.  His curiosity got the better of him, and he cracked the seal to open the envelope.  Inside was a small note, and two tickets.
 	
“What’s that?” she asked as she exited the walk-in closet.
 	
“A letter of some kind,” he said, pulling out the contents.  He handed her the note, then began to look at the tickets. “I don’t believe it,” he said, his mouth falling open.
 	
“What?” she asked, looking up from the letter.
 	
“They’re two tickets to tomorrow night’s show.”
 	
“Well, that explains this note,” she said, reading it aloud.



    _My Dearest Dia,
 	Please enjoy these two tickets on my behalf for the show tomorrow evening.  You and a friend are certainly going to be entertained for a wonderful evening. See you soon,
 											Auntie_
“Ugh,” she said, wrinkling her nose, “I bet it’s a musical number, isn’t it?”
 	

    “Not just any musical number or show,” he said, excitement beaming from his face. “These are tickets to see _The Pirates of Merchance_
    by Gilbert and Mulligan, put on by none other than the Royal Duchess’s Acting Society!”
 	
“So?” she asked, shrugging.
 	

    “You don’t get it, do you?” he said. “_The Pirates of Merchance_
    is a classic. A swashbuckling tale like no other, with a plot twist so great you’d never think of it.  It is next to impossible to get tickets, let alone tickets for a performance from the RDAS.  I know all the songs off by heart.”  He took in a deep breath, changing his stance to put his left foot out in front of him.  He put his right hand on his waist, while extending his left arm outwards and upwards. “When I was a lad in the Queen’s navy,” he began.  He immediately felt Dia’s index finger press against his lips, stopping him from singing further.
 	
“No,” she said earnestly. “No, this is not happening. You are not singing.”
 	
“But I,” he began.
 	
“No,” she said once more.  Then, he did something not even he expected he would do.  He got down on his knees and began to beg.
 	
“Please, can we go?” he asked, cupping his hands together. “I don’t ask for much, and it would be the highlight of this trip. A once-in-a-lifetime experience.”  He watched as she looked down at him, clearly unimpressed.  Then, he said the words which he would most likely later regret. “I’ll do anything you want if we can go.”
 	
She cocked an eyebrow in interest.  “Anything?” she asked, an amused smile creeping across her face.
 	
He realized then that he had backed himself into a corner in his excitement.
 	
“Well,” he began.
 	
“Oh no,” she said, reaching down and gently taking hold of his shirt collar.  She pulled him up, and close enough to meet her face. “You said ‘anything’ to see the show.  And I dislike musicals greatly.  So,” she said cooly, flashing the gold executive card between them. “After this afternoon’s race, you’re going to use this to book a reservation at the private dining establishment on board. Then you’re going to take me dancing.  After that, you’re going to rub my feet.”  He looked at her, realizing the web that she was weaving and beginning to regret saying ‘anything’.  “And,” she said slowly, “that’s just the beginning.”
 	
“Yes, dear,” he said, slowly nodding his head in understanding.
 	
“Good boy,” she said, letting go of his collar and gently tapping his cheek twice. “You can also unpack the rest of the suitcases.”  She tossed him the gold executive membership card, which he caught easily.
 	
“Where are you going?” he asked as she moved around him to retrieve her hat and headed for the door.
 	
“To get some sun, of course,” she said, and the door closed behind her.
 	
Turning to stare at the pile of luggage, he knew he had his work cut out for him.
