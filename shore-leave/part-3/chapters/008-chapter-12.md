Chapter 12

“Tonight was nice,” said Dia as she wrapped her left arm around Andrew’s waist while they exited the main dancing room for some air.  She had complained earlier of feeling slightly nauseous, and had asked that they temporarily step out for some air.  He had obliged her, and they were immediately met by the cool breeze off the water.  Small lights gently lit the railing, and in the distance the candle-like flicker of light from other ships or island communities dotted the seascape.
 	
“It was,” he said, doing the same to her with his right arm. “And I’m glad you decided to pace yourself with the wine.”
  	
She threw a glance at him as a smirk crossed her lips. 
 	
“Well, I needed to be sober enough to enjoy dancing and not embarrass myself,” she said as they found a spot near the railing that offered some space from other patrons.  She took a sip from the glass of red wine in her free hand. “And, this being only my fourth glass of wine over the last few hours, I’d say I handled myself well.”  She took another sip, her nose wrinkling at the taste of it. “Though why it suddenly tastes bitter is beyond me.”
 	
“Could be something to do with how it was prepared,” he said.
 	
“Possibly,” she said, taking another sip. Her nose wrinkled once more. 
 	
“Let me try,” he said, offering his hand for the glass.  She passed it to him, and watched as he took a quick sip. “Hmm … tastes fine to me.”  He handed the glass back to her. “A mild sweet taste that goes down smoothly -- much like my dancing I hope.”
 	
She gave a small laugh as she took the glass back from him. “Alright, I admit it.  You have some smooth moves … for a nerf herder.”
 	
“I’ll settle for being a handsome nerf herder if you want,” he said with a wink.
 	
She stood up on her tip-toes slightly and gave him a peck on his cheek, her purple lipstick leaving a faint mark on his skin.
 	
“I may be able to live with that,” she said. “Now if only I could get other women to stop hitting on you.”
 	
“Only one way to do that, dear,” he said, pulling her slightly closer, “and it involves expensive rings.”
 	
A sharp whistling sound came from their right as an object was launched skywards.  It exploded a few seconds later into a bright shower of red and green.  The fireworks for the evening had begun.
 	
“It wouldn’t be the worst idea,” she said after a moment as a second firework was launched into the air. “It would also be better than paying assault or blaster wound fees,” she finished as the second one exploded into a shower of yellow sparks.  They both laughed briefly at this last comment. “Though in truth, getting assigned to the same cruiser let alone ending the war is a long shot.  Especially with our current assignments.”
 	
He paused as the third and fourth fireworks rocketed into the air.
 	
“I’ve been meaning to talk to you about that,” he said before the firework exploded.  She moved the wine glass to her lips, this time taking a mouthful of the bitter wine.  As the firework exploded into another shower of red, green, and yellow, his news was like a bombshell hitting her.  “I’m putting an application in for a spot in Rogue Squadron.”
 	
She hiccoughed when he said this, wine snorting out her nose.  She made several hacking cough sounds, and took the napkin he produced from one of his pockets to quickly clean her face.
 	
“You’re WHAT?!” she said as she broke away from him, the sound of the rhythmic launching and explosion of fireworks partially masking her exclamation.  A few nearby patrons turned to briefly look at them before turning their attention to the show again.
 	
“I said, I’m--” he began.
 	
“I know what you said you nerf herder!” she said sternly.  A wave of red light cascaded across her blue face. “How can you even think of doing such a thing?”
 	
He stood there for several seconds, not saying anything, clearly baffled at her response.
 	
“Dia, I--” he began.  She held up one finger to stop him, and then drained her wine glass.  The bitter taste ran down her throat.
 	
“If you’re upset--” he began, but she cut him off.
 	
“Do you have any idea what that would entail?  What it would mean for you?  For us?”
 	
Once more he just stared at her, taken aback, his eyes searching for what to do next.
 	
“Take me back to the room,” she said, placing the wine glass on the ship’s thick railing, “now.”  Pivoting around, she began a brisk walk down the walkway, her shoes clacking against the deck, maneuvering her way through the stream of guests exiting the ballroom to watch the fireworks.  A knot began to form in her stomach.  She hadn’t liked this news at all.

Korwin Solari leaned against the railing of the upper deck of the ship.  He was alone, save for the gentle glow of the lights around him and the sound and shower of fireworks on display above him.  The wind was cool, giving the occasional whip as its strength increased then subsided.  He held a private commlink in his hand, and ensured he was on an encrypted channel.  A small earpiece in his ear carried the voice so only he could hear it, making the voice on the other end easier to hear over the noise.
 	
“And you’re sure that my new request will be honored?” he asked the speaker on the other end.
 	

“I will make no guarantees, Solari,” came Captain Gaspra’s voice. “With the _Sovereign, Vigilant,_ and other New Republic ships -- not to mention general security -- in the system, there is little room for error.”

 _Dammit_ he thought.
 	
“From here on out,” she continued, “any changes you make you will have to find a solution for.  However, if any of them jeopardize our plans, you will be the one to pay for it.  Dearly.”
 	
“I understand,” he said after a moment.
 	
“Good.  Maintain silence from here on out.  I will contact you again if necessary.”  With that, the connection ended.
 	
Solari gave a disheartened sigh.  Most of the plans were in place.  Everything timed to specific intervals.  They were a testament to Gaspra’s artistry as a seasoned Imperial officer who knew how to get a job done -- and done well.  But there was one thread that he had been unable to negotiate.  Taking care of it could prove to be costly.  But he was prepared to do whatever it took to see it succeed.
 	
Just then, he heard the faint clicking of women’s shoes between the explosions of fireworks on the wooden deck behind him.  He carefully removed the earpiece and gently placed it in his pocket with his communicator.
 	
“I hope I’m not interrupting you,” came Suli’s voice between fireworks blasts from behind him.
 	
“No,” he said after a moment.  He turned to face her, pressing away from the railing. “No, not at all.  I was just taking care of a business matter that had suddenly come up.”
 	
She stopped a few feet away from him, arms neatly folded at the wrists in front of her.  Even in this light, and in the cool breeze, she was beauty incarnate.
 	
“I can appreciate that,” she said, looking down at the deck momentarily.
	
He paused for a moment, contemplating what she could be after now.
 	
“If I might ask directly,” he said, ensuring to not show his true feelings, “is there something else I can do for you this evening?  Or have you come to insult me further?”
 	
“There is,” she said after a moment.  He watched as she fiddled with the small purse in her hands. “What I said earlier was uncalled for.  And deeply personal.”
 	
He stared at her, his face an image of stone.
 	
“I hope,” she continued over the noise, taking a few steps closer, “that you can forgive me for that.  If not now, then in time.  It’s one thing to be business rivals.  But it’s another to be a hostess and treat one’s guests poorly.  I … know your family and sister mean a lot to you.  Just like how much my dear husband means to me.  I used my knowledge of your tragedy inappropriately.  I’m sorry.”
 	
He hadn’t been prepared for this apology from her.  He took several steps towards her as the light from the fireworks washed over both of them.  “Thank you, Suli,” he said after a few moments with a slight bow of his head. “I am sure I can look to forgive you in time.”  More fireworks continued to explode above them, the wind picking up some speed.  “Now if you’ll excuse me,” he said, beginning to make his way past her, “I have a busy day tomorrow that I need to plan for.”
  	
“Korwin,” she said, extending an arm out to stop him and gently taking his arm.  “One more thing.”
 	
“Yes?” he asked, meeting her gaze.
 	
Her emerald green eyes met his, her golden ruby necklace shining brightly in the night.  He watched as she momentarily bit her lip, then began her next sentence.
 	
“Regardless of what I said earlier,” she said, finding the words she wanted to say, “and regardless of our previous business dealings … deep down, I believe you to be a good person.” Another round of fireworks erupted into the air before taking on different shapes as they exploded.  “It would be nice to see more of that.”
 	
He momentarily considered her words before changing his stance to face her, taking her hand as a gentleman would.  He wouldn’t necessarily forgive her -- not just yet -- but that wouldn’t stop him from being a gentleman in this moment.
 	
“I assure you my dear, whatever decisions I make, I make for the good of everyone.  Including yourself.  I appreciate you coming to offer an apology.”  He raised her hand and kissed it gently in a show of respect. “Enjoy the rest of your evening.”
 	
He left her there, pondering his actions, and descended the staircase to continue adjusting his plans for tomorrow.

Dia continued her march down the walkway of the ship towards their cabin.  Her stomach was churning, which greatly annoyed her.
 	
“Dia,” Andrew called, his pace increasing behind her.  “Dia, wait!”  Within a few seconds he had caught up to her.  She felt his hand gently take her arm.  
 	
She stopped and spun around to face him.
 	
“Can’t we talk about this?” he asked her.
 	
“We will,” she said tersely. She turned to continue her walk forward.  He kept pace with her.
 	
“Okay,” he said, moving up beside her. “Probably not the best time to drop the news.  But don’t you think you’re overreacting just a bit?”
 	
Her stomach churned and roiled.
 	
“No,” she said flatly.
 	
“Then what’s the problem?” he asked.
 	
She stopped a few feet later, a hand moving to her stomach.  A Mon Calamari deckhand held a mop and was scrubbing the deck ahead of them, occasionally dipping the mop in the portable cleaning bucket.
 	
“Do you realize the kinds of missions those pilots fly?  What their turnover rate is?”
 	
Sharp pains began tearing their way across the inside of her stomach.  She winced in pain.
 	
“I do,” he said after a moment. “But they need good pilots.  I thought….”
 	
She moved to place a hand against the wall while keeping the other on her stomach.  
 	
“Ahh,” she said as the pain once more made its way across her stomach.
 	
“...hey … what’s wrong?” Andrew asked, changing his line of conversation.
 	
“I,” she began.  Her stomach did a few somersaults. “I don’t feel so….”  Sweat had begun to bead on her brow.  She felt like she wanted to vomit.  Quickly looking for her options, she saw that she was limited.  If she moved to vomit over the railing, it would fall down below onto another deck and possibly other passersby.  “Oh....,” she moaned, “I don’t feel so….” Seeing her only option, she rushed a few steps forward.
 	
And vomited into the cleaning bucket of the Mon Calamari several times.
 	
The Mon Calamari looked on with annoyance and disbelief, his shoulders sagging.
 	
“Ohmigosh,” Dia moaned, wiping her mouth.  She felt Andrew near her.  He placed one hand on her back, the other to briefly look at her face.
 	
“You look pale,” he said.
 	
“I feel awful,” she said after a moment.
 	
“Which way to the nearest medical bay?” she heard Andrew ask the Mon Calamari.
 	
“Deck three,” she heard the Mon Calamari say. “Take the stairs up ahead on your right.”
 	
“Come on,” Andrew said, gently taking hold of her.  She puked one final time before finding the strength to stand up and go with him.
 	
“Don’t think this stops our conversation,” she said between breaths as they made their way towards the stairs.

:::


 	
They entered the medical bay a few minutes later.  The medical staff was busy attending to two other patients who seemed to have similar conditions to Dia’s vomiting.
 	
A B1 medical droid met them, directing them to the last patient table in the room.
 	
“When did it begin happening?” inquired the droid.
 	
“Just a few minutes ago,” Andrew said.  “She was fine, then she started vomiting.”
 	
“Ma’am, can you describe the feeling?”
 	
Dia looked up at the droid from where she was sitting on the table.  “It’s like a mix of your stomach churning and then sharp cramp-like pains running across your stomach,” she began.  Just then, the attending physician walked over to them.  It was an ugnaught dressed in a small white doctor’s coat.
 	
“Good evening, sir. Ma’am,” he said, hopping up onto the nearby stool.  “I”m doctor Tamka.  What seems to be the problem here?”
 	
“A case of vomiting and stomach pains,” said the medical droid. “Much like the other two patients here.”
 	
“I see,” said the ugnaught, rubbing his chin. “By chance did you eat the Eudoran shrimp at the gala this evening?  And drink any red wine at any point?”
 	
Dia nodded quickly, the odd tear running down her face.
	
“Ah, an easy diagnosis, then.  You, my dear, have a mild form of toxicity poisoning -- or food poisoning, if you’d prefer simpler terms.”
 	
“How is that possible?” Andrew asked.
 	
“Eudoran shrimp are a delicacy,” said the doctor, turning to look at him. “But, if they are not cooked correctly, they can secrete a mild toxin into the consumer’s stomach.”
 	
“I was wondering why some of the shrimp tasted a bit gamey,” moaned Dia.  A burp escaped her mouth.
 	
“That toxin, combined with the sulfur dioxide that is naturally added to the wine to help keep it fresh, increases the toxin’s potency.  It is also why you may have felt the wine taste bitter rather than its normal sweet flavour.”
 	
“That explains it,” said Dia as the medical droid handed her a paper cup full of water.  She downed it quickly.
 	
“I typically see a few cases each year of this, so the prognosis is simple.”  He hopped down off the stool and went to a cabinet, fetching a small box with pills in it.  He ripped two square foils from it.
 	
“Take one of these every twelve hours for the next twenty-four hours,” he said, handing them to Andrew. “Drink plenty of water, and stay away from any form of alcohol.  I also suggest consuming foods such as soups, and plenty of bed rest.  If the symptoms still persist beyond tomorrow night, contact the medical line for an immediate follow-up.”
 	
“Thank you, doctor,” Andrew said as he began to gather up Dia.  “Honey … do you think you can make it back to the cabin?”
 	
“Yeah,” she said tiredly.  “Yeah I can.”
 	
As they were dismissed from the medical room, he held her as she slowly made her way back towards their room.

When they got back, she was able to slip out of her dress and into her nightgown on her own.  BD-B2 watched in curiosity as she took the first pill and drank a tall glass full of water.  Wiping her brow, she climbed into the bed and wrapped herself in the blankets.  Andrew eventually did the same.  They both lay in silence for some time.
 	
“Do you still want to talk?” he asked her finally.
 	
She rolled over slowly to look at him.  She looked about as good as she felt, which was horrible.
 	
“We should,” she mumbled. “But right now, I just want to sleep.”
 	
“Okay,” he said.
 	
She looked at him, then closed her eyes and sighed.  She then fumbled underneath the blankets for his hand, and squeezed it when she found it.
 	
“Not the greatest ending to the evening,” she said weakly. “But it was still mostly enjoyable.”
 	
“Good,” he said, squeezing hers back.
 	
“You know,” she said after a minute, “this could also be a blessing in disguise.”
 	
“How so?” he asked.
 	
She opened her eyes partially. “If I’m still not feeling well, I don’t have to sit through tomorrow’s musical,” she said with a small laugh.

He awoke the next morning to gentle and constant breathing from her, as well as imitations of snoring sounds coming from BD-B2. The little droid was crouched on the side-table next to Dia’s edge of the bed.  His optics closed, his head gently rose while making a snoring sound, then lowered as it let out a series of sounds.
 	
_Snore … wah wah wah wah wah wah… snore … wah wah wah wah wah wah._

Shaking his head in amusement, he got up to have a quick shower, then ordered room service for breakfast.  The food was moderately priced, surprisingly enough, and arrived within half an hour of placing the order.  
 	
“How are you feeling?” he asked her as she sat up in bed, slowly working her way through a bowl of oatmeal.
 	
“A bit better,” she said, another burp escaping her mouth, “but still awful.”
 	
“Would you like me to keep you company?” he asked her.
 	
“Maybe for a little bit,” she said, placing her bowl of oatmeal on the tray.  She nursed a glass of orange juice next, then set it on the dresser. “I just feel like resting for the rest of the day.  Why don’t you go out and enjoy yourself?  There’s lots of events going on today.”
 	
Eventually, he did just that, leaving her to sleep.  The events were plentiful and varied; there was something for everyone aboard, be it a sport, games, contests, the casino, or live presentations.  He checked up on her every once in a while, little seeming to change in her desire for rest, even after taking the second pill -- though she was looking better as the day went on.
 	
He spent the afternoon participating in some sports activities.  After finishing a few rounds of kanji-ball, a game involving teams scoring points by bouncing balls off of spring nets, he was met by a familiar face on his way to the change rooms.
 	
“Didn’t expect to meet you here, stranger,” said the chocolate-skinned woman with dark hair and a honey-sweet voice.
 	
Andrew turned around to see a familiar figure.
 	
“Captain Supriya,” he said, flashing a smile. “What a surprise!  What brings you here?”
 	

“Command is still working on finding me a proper ship after the _Destiny_ was destroyed,” she said as the two walked out of the arena and into the sunlight.  Birds cawed overhead as the ship sailed its way across the ocean. “You’d think with the gains we’ve made that another cruiser would be in order, but for the time being I’m captaining a modified corvette.  Had some leave time built up, so decided to take a break and get some fresh air.”
 	
They decided to go to one of the outdoor seating areas, each ordering a drink and a light snack, catching up on events since their last encounter.  He also regaled her with his adventures with Dia and the Vigilant since their last encounter, leaving out the deeply personal details of course.  When he told her about the tickets to the show that evening, she perked up.
 	

“You’re a fan of _The Pirates of Merchance_, too?” she asked earnestly.
 	
“I am,” he said with a sheepish laugh.
 	
“And here I thought I was the only one,” she said.  “You’re a lucky guy. Not many get to have a vacation like this.”
 	
“You know,” he said after a moment. “Dia isn’t really keen on musicals, and most likely won’t be joining me this evening.”  He leaned forward, his arms crossed on the table. “How’d you like to trade in your ticket for a more premium one?  Ours aren’t exactly front-row seats, but they’re still pretty good.”
 	
“Really?” she exclaimed in excitement, then recomposed herself. “Well, it wouldn’t feel right taking her ticket….”
 	
“How about this,” he said, giving a counter-offer. “If she changes her mind and decides to attend, just swap tickets and seats.  Things would then be as they were.  Think of it as keeping her seat warm for her.”
 	
Supriya gave a small laugh and a smile. “Done.”
 	
“Great,” he said as she handed him her ticket. “I’ll meet you at the entrance at six.”

He went back to the room for supper.  Dia was in the bathroom, and he could hear the shower running.
 	
“How are you feeling?” he called to her.
 	
“Better,” she said after a moment, “though still not at one-hundred percent.”
 	
“If you don’t mind, I ran into an old friend while I was out and about.  We’re going to meet and see the show together.  You don’t mind, do you?”
 	
The water stopped, and there was a pause for a minute or two.  She emerged with her housecoat on, wiping away at her face and lekku with a towel.  Despite sounding better, she still looked pale.
 	
“Not really,” she said, sitting down on the bed.  “Just leave me a ticket in case I feel good enough to go.”
 	
“I’ll leave you this one,” he said, swapping out the tickets.  “If you are feeling better, I’ll meet you near the bar during the intermission so we can swap seats.”  
 	
He kissed her forehead as she climbed back into bed.
 	
BD-B2 scurried out the door and away as Andrew opened it.
 	
“Where’s he off to?” Andrew asked.
 	
“Who knows?” said Dia, waving her hand. “But it’s probably for the best.  He’s been going stir-crazy all day.”

They met at the entrance.  Supriya was wearing a casual pair of black pants with a navy blue shirt and a tan leather jacket.  He, likewise, was dressed down to casual wear for the evening.
 	
“If you don’t mind my say,” he said as they bought some popcorn and beverages, “you clean up well.”
 	
“A little indulgence from time to time never hurt anyone,” she said as they walked down the port of the ship. “And I like to dress smartly and sharply.”
 	
The sun hung low in the sky as it had begun its descent for the day, with night on its heels.  It wasn’t long before they were ushered to their seats, which also began to fill.  They were a number of rows back of the stage, but still within good eyesight.  Other ticket holders from numerous worlds and walks of life trickled into the make-shift theatre to find their seats.  Up on the stage, stage hands were setting up the scenery for the opening number.
 	
“I still can’t get over the size and make-up of this ship,” he said. “It’s unbelievable.”
 	
“Makes the ships we serve on seem like rusty old tins cans, doesn’t it?” she said with a wink.
 	
“Hey,” he said with a laugh, “some of them probably are.”  
 	
As the stage crew left the stage, an announcer came out through the main door set up on the stage, as would traditionally be set up in any theatre.
 	

“Ladies and gentlemen, beings of all ages,” her voice rang out as the PA system came to life. “I’d like to welcome you to tonight’s performance of _The Pirates of Merchance_ performed by the illustrious and multi-world renowned Royal Duchess’s Acting Society!”
 	
A wave of applause rose from the crowd.  The stages actors began to exit in a straight line, each turning left or right as they came out.  
 	
“Tonight is a special night,” continued the announcer, “as the actors and actresses behind me performs for the first time a new, more updated version of the play suitable for a modern audience.”
 	
“This should be fun,” Supriya murmured to Andrew, who nodded in agreement.
 	
“The Acting Society will begin with their opening number shortly, which we would like to dedicate to our two patrons of this event -- Mister Korwin Solari, and Miss Suli deChenzzi!”
 	
A round of applause once more spilled through the audience, many of whom stood up to turn around and applaud in their direction.  Twisting around in his seat, Andrew saw the two of them in one of several private boxes to the right of them on the upper level of the ship.  Each stood up to address the crowd, smiling and waiving.
 	
“And now,” continued the announcer, “I’ll kindly ask that you take your seats, and refrain from taking any holo pics during the show so as to not distract the actors.  Ladies and gentlemen, beings of all ages, without further ado I give you _The Pirates of Merchance_!”
 	
An enthusiastic buzz rose through the crowd as the acting troupe stepped forward.  As the lights dimmed, their song began and they began moving about the stage for their introductory number.  Once this had finished, most of the actors left the stage, leaving one of the lead actors -- a Mon Calamari male --  to begin the first number.
 	
“When I was a lad in the Queen’s navy,” he began, “I cleaned the windows and swept the floor….”
 	
Andrew and Supriya drank up the performance, as did others around them, quietly mouthing the words as the song continued.
 	
The rest of the first few scenes were similar as the other principal and secondary characters were introduced, as was the main villain -- The Pirate King of Merchance.
 	
“Quite the show,” said Supriya, who had nearly finished her popcorn.  Andrew nodded in agreement.  As the scene came to a close and began to transition to the second act, Andrew thought he heard several humming sounds that were rapidly getting closer and louder.  
 	
No sooner had the Pirate King and a handful of his pirate goons made their way back onto the stage than four small sailing skiffs rose over the bow of the ship.  A little more than two dozen humans and beings from other races jumped from the skiffs and began making their way into the crowd and onto the stage.
 	
“Considering that this is the scene where the pirate troupe is introduced in full, I’m surprised they went all out with the costumes and special effects,” said Supriya. 
 	
Andrew, who had shifted his attention to the stage actors, saw an entirely different scene unfolding.  The actors were looking baffled and not continuing on with their part of the scene.
 	
“I don’t think they’re actors,” he said, quickly turning to Supriya.  “We have to go. Now.”
 	
“Why?” she asked.  Then she saw what he did and the same idea dawned on her.
 	
“Nobody move!” came a booming voice over the PA system. “Stay where you are and don’t move!”
 	
The crowd, thinking this was part of the act, gave a round of applause.  That changed once a handful of blaster shots screamed in the air as shots rose towards the sky.  People began to scream and panic as the newly arrived individuals moved through the crowd, trying to maintain control.
 	
“Just our luck to encounter _real_ pirates on a vacation,” Andrew said as he and Supriya squeezed their way out of their row and began sprinting towards the exit.  A number of other theatregoers had the same idea.  More blaster shots continued to fill the air as people screamed and cried.
 	
“Nobody move!” came the voice over the PA system. “Stay where you are, or we will shoot!”
 	
They were about to hit the exit when another skiff full of eight pirates rose to their right above the railing.  Those trying to escape stopped where they were, forced back by the new group of pirates.
	
“Come on,” said Supriya as she grabbed Andrew’s hand and pulled him to the left.  A hatch near the wall leading to who knew where was their only chance to escape.  No one else had seemed to notice it.  Flinging it open, Andrew was the first to slide down the ladder while Supriya followed closely behind, closing the hatch behind her.
 	
“Do you have a comm link on you?” he asked.
 	
“I don’t,” she panted.
 	
“Where did they come from?” he asked.
 	
“Your guess is as good as mine.  Could be related to the attacks and kidnappings that have been going on over the last few months.  Come on, we need to keep moving.”
 	
They began to make their way down the hallway, being attentive. They were clearly in a maintenance tunnel or area of the ship of some sort.
 	
“What do you mean, attacks?” he asked.
 	
“According to the media, pirates have been making random attacks on resorts and other cruises over time.  Local authorities have been baffled and unable to stop them.  Most have taken place on the main world, several have taken place on this moon -- though all of those have been in other provinces.”
 	

“If it's this serious, we need to alert the security team.  Or the _Vigilant_,” Andrew said.
 	
“Agreed,” said Supriya, her feet pounding on the deck plating. “But we need to be careful.  This could be happening elsewhere on the ship.”

Suli watched in horror as the scene unfolded in front of her. Blaster shots rang through the air as people panicked and tried to find shelter or run away.  A number of stun ring blasts lanced out towards the theatregoers.
 	
“Miguel,” said Suli, producing a commlink from her purse. “Miguel, come in!” static filled the airwaves.  Suli turned to look at Seela, who was equally concerned.  Just then, Solari burst through the curtain behind them.
 	
“If I might be tactful,” he said, moving quickly towards them, “we should all leave. Now.”
  	
Suli didn’t want to abandon the people below, but she had no choice.  Rising out of her seat, she took Seela’s hand and the trio exited her private booth.  They began making their way through the corridors of the ship.  She tried to raise the captain as well, without success.
 	
“We have to get to security,” said Suli. “Or the bridge and alert the captain.”
 	
“It would be better,” said Solari as they turned the corner, “if we could get off the ship.”
 	
“And leave these people?” protested Suli. “I think not!”
 	
Korwin stopped and wheeled around to face her.
 	
“It’s better if we get you to safety,” he said.  She gave him a puzzled look, trying to understand his meaning.  “Trust me.  Let’s go.”
 	
They continued down the hall and rounded another corner -- only to be met by four Imperial stormtroopers.
 	
“Freeze!” said the lead stormtrooper. “Don’t -- aaaaugh!”
 	
Suli surged forward, brushing against Korwin’s shoulder, and used her four tentacled appendages to grab ahold of the four stormtroopers.  With some effort, she bounced each several times against the walls and floors until they dropped their blasters or were rendered motionless.
 	
“Did you just?...” Seela began.
 	
“They’ll be fine when they wake up,” Suli said.  “Come on.”
 	
“There they are!” came a voice from behind them. 
 	
Suli glanced behind her to see Miguel charging down the hallway, four stormtroopers in tow.  A door opened behind Solari to reveal another fresh group of stormtroopers.  They were cornered, unable to move forward or fall back without risking a firefight.
 	
“Miguel,” said Suli as the squads cornered them. “What is the meaning of this?  Why are Imperial troops on my ship?”
 	
“I’m sorry, ma’am,” Miguel said as he stopped, producing a pair of handcuffs. “But I have no choice.  Two nights ago my wife and little girls were taken hostage.  If I don’t do what they want, they’ll be killed.”
 	
The stormtroopers clicked their blasters.
 	
Solari bent down and picked up one of the blasters that lay strewn on the ground from the first group.  As he stood up, he pointed it at the two women.
 	
“Korwin?” Suli asked.  “Are you…?”
 	
“Whatever our differences,” he said, a click sounding from the blaster, “I’m doing what I am for the greater good.  I hope in time you’ll understand.”
 	
Before she could say anything, he fired and the world went black.
