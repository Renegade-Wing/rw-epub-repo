Chapter 10
:::
	
Korwin Solari sat alone in his private quarters on the _SS Starfish_. He had ordered his droid to stand watch outside the entrance, ensuring that he was not disturbed.  He had given Ceryss specific instructions to prepare for the dinner this evening, as well as take care of some last-minute business.  As he sat in his padded armchair, drink in hand, the holographic figure of Captain Gaspra on his private, encrypted channel, stood in front of him.
 	
“Well, Solari,” she said, hands behind her back. “Did the plan work?”
 	
“It did,” he said, raising his crystal glass to savour the smell of the brandy he had poured. “But there may be a problem.”
 	
Gaspra’s eyes narrowed.
 	
“What sort of problem?” she asked slowly. Taking a sip from his glass, he decided it was best to choose his next words carefully.
 	
“I believe that Suli deChenzzi suspects something.  She was very suspicious of the events earlier today.”
 	
“Does she know it was you?” Gaspra asked coldly.
 	
Korwin swirled his glass slowly, the brandy moving around the inside gracefully.
 	
“Suspecting is one thing. Proving is quite another.  Need I remind you, deChenzzi is well-known for her intelligence and tact, among her other qualities.”
 	
As he took another sip from his glass, Gaspra sighed.
 	
“She could pose a problem.  If this is the case, I need to accelerate our timetable sooner than I thought.”
 	
Korwin was surprised at this last comment.  He hadn’t anticipated this move from Gaspra.
 	
“So soon?” he asked casually, not betraying his concerns. “What about our agreement?”
 	
“You’ll get what you want, Solari, once the job is finished.  But only once it’s finished.”
 	
“Very well,” he said, nodding. “And what of the … security problem?”
 	
“It’s being taken care of.  Discreetly.  Gaspra out.”
 	
As the hologram faded into nothingness, Korwin finished the last of his drink.  Setting the glass down on top of the coaster in front of him, he stood up and walked over to the viewport window.  The sun had begun to set, casting its long, waning shadow along the ocean.  Oranges, reds, and purples blended across the sky as the lone jewel that was the sun began to hide behind the darkening figure of Star Island in the distance.  The wind picked up speed and howled as it ran across the window.  Realizing the task ahead of him, his parents’ words once more tickled the back of his mind. 
 	

    _A Solari must always do what needs to be done.  No matter the cost. There is no doubt, no apprehension.  Only success._
“For you mama … papa,” he said quietly to himself. “Always for you.”  Turning to ready himself for the evening, he began to prepare for the machinations to come.

_[Lounge, CRS Vigilant - 1800 hours]_   
	
Lieutenant Colonel Reynolds sat tipped back in his chair, feet up on the table, drink in his hand.  The lounge aboard the Vigilant was sparsely populated with personnel and pilots.  Iggy mechanically wiped the bar counter down for what must have been the sixth time that evening.  Taking a sip from his mug, he let out a sigh.
 	
_I could get used to this, he thought. Now all I need is some sand, sun, and--_

“Hey, turn up the volume!” he heard someone say.
 	
As the volume increased, Reynolds began to hear what was a sports broadcast begin
to play.
 	
“An exciting race this afternoon during the Contessa’s Cup,” said the reporter as images from the race flashed across the holovid screen.  “According to eyewitnesses, the annual race was sabotaged.  Instead of flying the traditional track like in previous years, the racing security measures were overridden and switched to a more challenging track setting.  Several racers crashed or withdrew from the race, but thankfully no one was hurt.”

_Lucky them_ thought Reynolds, savouring another sip from his drink.
 	
“While Eudoran security personnel are investigating the issue, the race still went ahead due to a communications error.  And what a race it was!  The legendary Red Angels were forced into third place, a huge upset for them.”  
 	
Images flashed across the screen of the Red Angels making mistakes or being forced to loop around the track rings again. One shot in particular showed a Z-95 and a T-wing using the shielding as a slingshot maneuver to shoot ahead of one of the Red Angel racers and cross the finish line.
 	
“Finishing in second place were underdogs and new fan-favourites Ledwin Kes and Imzi Noan.” The holovid switched to show the three top teams standing on their own leveled podiums. “And believe it or not, two New Republic pilots claimed first prize.  Shown here are Major Andrew Dobson and Captain Dia Tann.”
 	
Reynolds choked on his drink as soon as he heard their names.  His feet slammed down on the deck plating, and he caught himself on the table with his free hand as the chair fell forward.
 	
“They WHAT?!” he exclaimed.
 	
“Quiet down!” said someone else as several individuals turned to look at Reynolds.
 	
He stared in disbelief as Andrew and Dia smiled and waved from their spot on the podium along with the Duros and Rodian.  The third-place winners didn’t look that happy, and refused to wave.
 	
“The first prize was ten-thousand credits….”
 	
“Ten-thousand credits,” Reynolds said to himself in awe. “Son of a moof-milker….”
 	
“The victors had this to say….”  The video cut to a new image of Andrew and Ledwin, an arm around each other’s shoulder, talking to reporters.
 	
“What do you attribute to your win today?  And how do you feel?” asked the reporter.
 	
The two racers wore smiles on their faces. 
 	
“It all comes down to teamwork,” Andrew said, looking at Ledwin and the reporters. “Even if you’re on a different team.  And some fancy flying.”
 	
“And that last-second maneuver you did,” the reporter said, pressing the microphone in closer. “What do you call that?”
 	
“Just nothing but ‘blast and fast’, baby! Wooo!!” cheered Andrew.
 	
As Ledwin repeated the phrase and cry of enthusiasm, a round of laughter arose throughout the room.
 	
“And Ledwin,” said the reporter, turning the microphone to him. “How does it feel to be the first racer in four years to win the Solari Star, worth twenty-thousand credits?”
 	
Ledwin removed his arm from around Andrew.  The vid camera zoomed to focus on him. 
 	
“It feels … it feels….” Tears began to well up in the Duros’s eyes. “It’s an unbelievable game-changer, that’s for sure.  Excuse me … I have something in my eyes!”  
	
With that, Ledwin turned around and began to walk away, using his sleeve to wipe away his tears of joy.
 	
“And there you have it, folks!  A win of a lifetime, with possibly more to come.  This is Iqbal Billiebobbie Bahar, signing off.”
 	
“That was a fortuitous win for them,” said the droid Syntax, Corsair Squadron’s leader, as he sauntered up where Reynolds was sitting.  The news broadcast shifted to another story.
 	
“I know,” said Reynolds, turning to look at the droid. “What are the odds, eh?”
 	
“Actually, the odds of that happening are--”
 	
“On second thought,” said Reynolds, holding a hand up to stop the droid, “I don’t want to know.”

“Careful,” said Andrew as Dia tightened the red bow tie around his neck. “I need enough room to breathe.”
 	
“Just making sure,” she said, straightening the tie, “that no more crazy ideas get to your head.”
 	
“How do I look?” he asked when she was done, stepping back and holding his arms out.  He was surprised to find a tuxedo rental shop on the cruise ship.  Especially one with his size.
 	
“Like a dollop of handsome with a dash of charming,” she said, reaching up to squeeze his cheek.
 	
BD-B2 gave a hoot of approval from the dresser.
 	
“I’m surprised the little stowaway agrees,” he said, eying the droid.  They had found him hiding in the closet when they returned from the race.  Unsure exactly which bag he had hid himself in, there was nothing to do but accept that he was here.  “I still don’t understand how he made it aboard.  We packed those bags thoroughly.”
 	
“It doesn’t matter now,” Dia said with a sigh. “Okay, since my make-up is already done, I’m going to go change.  I’ll only be a minute or two, then we’ll go.”
 	
As she turned to head towards the walk-in closet, BD-B2 hopped down off the dresser.  His little legs made pattering sounds on the floor as he followed her.
 	
“Oh no you don’t,” she said, turning to point at the droid. “You stay right there!  No way you get to ruin the surprise.”
 	
The droid gave a sound that was similar to someone saying “phooey” and turned back to race towards Andrew.  He was about to climb Andrew’s leg when Andrew jerked his leg back.
 	
“Oh no you don’t, you little stowaway!” Andrew said. “The tux and shoes are rentals.  If you scuff or ruin them, I don’t get my deposit back.”
 	
The droid looked up at him in wonder, tilting his head. 
 	
“And if I don’t get my deposit back, that means I’m not paying for any upgrades to your computer systems.”
 	
The droid carefully considered what Andrew said, and began to back away slowly.
 	
It wasn’t long before Dia emerged from the walk-in closet. As the door slid open, Andrew’s jaw dropped.  BD-B2 gave a sharp double-whistle.
 	
She was wearing a red headdress and maxi dress with off-shoulder ruffles.  Her skirt flowed down far enough that he could just see her painted toenails and heeled dancing shoes.  As she walked forward, the modest thigh slit revealed part of her leg. He could also see that the shoes had criss-crossed leather lacing that ran up a few times to her calves. Three golden ringlets hung from her left wrist, and her cylindrical ornamental gold chain earrings swayed rhythmically as she moved. Her lips were painted in a rich purple lipstick that complemented her dress and skin.
 	
“It’s rude to stare, you know,” she said with a wink.  Holding her white purse in front of her, she shifted her position to stick a hand on her hip and one leg out. “Well?” she asked. “What do you think?”
 	
“Like an angel,” he said finally.
 	
She flashed him a coy smile, then crossed the distance of the room to stand in front of him.
 	
“Thought you’d say that,” she said, looking up at him.
 	
“Any chance we could just stay here? Maybe order in instead?”
 	
“Fat chance,” she said, tapping him playfully with her purse. “Besides, after your stunt earlier, you owe me.  Big time.”
 	
“Yeah,” he said, letting out a short sigh. “You’re right.”
	
“But,” she said slowly, gently taking hold of his white carnation and adjusting it, “if you’re good and manage to impress, there’s a possibility for some fun later tonight.”  She stood up slightly, moving towards his right ear. “But only if you impress,” she whispered.
 	
Andrew’s face blushed slightly, and BD-B2 gave another cheeky whistle.  This garnered him a look of annoyance from the both of them, which in turn caused him to give a playful titter of a laugh.
 	
“Any chance for a holo pic?  For memory’s sake?” Andrew asked.  She turned to face him again.
 	
“Sure,” she said. “Bee-Dee, will you do the honors?”
 	
The droid nodded, and positioned himself on the dresser they were standing in front of.  Moving his arm around her waist to draw her in closer, she turned and put an arm on his chest while moving her leg partly in front of her.  With a few clicks, the droid took a picture, and gave a few beeps to indicate that he was finished.
 	
“Shall we get going, lest we be late?” he asked.
 	
“We shall,” she said with a smile.
 	
As they made their way towards the entrance, he opened the door and held it for her.  She walked through and waited for him to exit and close the door.  As it clicked shut, she took his arm and they made their way to the dining hall and ballroom of the ship.
