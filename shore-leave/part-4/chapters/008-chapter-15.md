Chapter 15
:::
 	
Stun bolts whizzed past the pair as they ran down the hall.  A pair of stormtroopers weren’t far behind.
 	
“I guess it’s a good thing they have terrible aim,” Andrew huffed.  Supriya reached back and fired two shots at their pursuers, which missed.
 	
“I’m not doing much better,” she said between breaths. “And I’m not even wearing a helmet!”
 	
They rounded the corner to their left -- and met another pair of stormtroopers running down the hall towards them.
 	
“There they are!” called one of the troopers. “You there! Stop!”
 	
Andrew and Supriya doubled back and began running down the new corridor.  Supriya shot at one of the troopers from the first pair as they were much closer now.  The trooper hit the floor like a sack of bricks.
 	
“Nice shot,” he huffed.
 	
“Thanks,” she said as more stun rings whizzed by.
 	
The end of the corridor with the emergency exit was quickly approaching.  Andrew was the first to reach it.  He pressed the button and made to dash through the door, but ended up slamming into it instead.  It was locked. 
 	
“Ugh,” he grunted.  Supriya stopped short of the door and turned to face the three troopers.  She was about to fire when a live blaster bolt shot past her head and left a fiery black mark on the side of the wall.
 	
“Freeze!” called the trooper. “Drop your blasters!”
 	
The two companions froze.
 	
“I said drop them!”
 	
They were about to lower their blasters onto the floor when the lights went out, leaving them all in pitch-black darkness -- except for a pair of bold blue eyes racing along the floor behind them a few seconds later.
 	
“What the--?” said one of the troopers. 
 	
“Switch visual processors to night vision,” said a second.
 	
The third gave a quick scream as something began clawing at his legs.  That something also gave a distinct series of hoots and chittering noises.  
 	
“Get it off!” called the trooper. “Get it off!”
 	
Andrew and Supriya didn’t waste any time sending shots into the troopers’ general direction.  As the blue rings lit up the dark hallway, a few of the several shots connected with the troopers.  
 	
The lights came back on a few seconds later, revealing the troopers in a heap on the floor -- and BDB2 standing triumphant on top of them.
 	
“Bee-Dee!” Andrew said enthusiastically. “Am I glad to see you!”
 	
BD gave an enthusiastic whoop.
 	
“You know this droid?” Supriya asked.
 	
“I do,” he said, “and it’s a bit of a long story.  Come here, boy,” he said placing the blaster underneath his armpit.  Kneeling down, he extended his arms.  The droid complied happily and let Andrew pick him up.  “Now, think you can open this door for us?”  BD-B2 hooted enthusiastically.
 	
“Wait,” Supriya said.  
 	
Andrew and BD turned to look at her.
 	
“Continuously running into stormtroopers is slowing us down.  The more time we waste, the less chance we have of contacting the ships in orbit and helping people.  Fastest way to the hangar would be in disguise.”
 	
Andrew looked at the three troopers behind them.
 	
“Wouldn’t be a bad idea,” he said.
 	
They dragged the three troopers into the stairwell after BD-B2 opened the door.  It only took them a few minutes to put the armor on, and they made sure to cuff the troopers as well.  Supriya also hit each of them with another round of stun blasts just to be safe.
 	
“Okay,” he said through the helmet mic. “Which way?”
 	
“Finding a service lift would take time,” she said. “I say we go straight down.  Have Bee-Dee scout ahead.” 
 	
The droid looked up at them, and gave a hoot of approval before hopping up on the railing and using it as a slide.  He did the same as he raced ahead down the next set of stairs.
 	
“He’s not a very conspicuous droid, is he?” Supriya asked.
 	
“Only when he wants to be,” Andrew said. “Let’s go.”

Dia and her companions knelt behind two abandoned dining carts that had been abandoned in one of the entrances to a large reception area.  Pirates and stormtroopers were escorting small groups of people at regular intervals to what must have been one of the dining halls. She took a quick peek over the top to take in the scene before concealing herself again.
 	
“There’s too many people to do anything,” she whispered. “They’d mostly be between us and the pirates or troopers.  We’ll have to wait.”
 	
Reginald gave her an antsy look. “Yet we cannot wait here forever,” he said quietly. “We need to keep our momentum, lest we be found.”
 	
“Agreed,” she said.  She heard footsteps coming down the adjacent hallway.  Everyone held their breaths.
 	
“Move along,” growled one of the pirates. “We haven’t got all day.”
 	
A few sobs came from some of the people being escorted down the hall.
 	
Everyone froze as a set of footprints came towards the carts.
 	
“Hello,” said a high-pitched raspy voice, “what do we have here?”
 	
“Marko,” bellowed another voice. “What in blazes are you doing?”
 	
“Aw, come on, Brixx!” he complained. “We haven’t had a decent meal in days, and this cart looks loaded with delicious foods.”  
 	
Dia saw part of the alien pirate -- a green-skinned Falleen man with a long, black ponytail -- walk backwards towards the cart.  Her eyes went wide.  No one breathed a word, though they all slowly pointed their blasters up at the man.
 	
“Marko!  Get back over here!  You can think about your stomach later.”
 	
“Aww, come on, not even a little?”  Marko turned and lifted the metal lid off of one of the trays. “It’ll only take....” he trailed off, now noticing the small group of wide-eyed individuals beyond the dining carts. “Oh kriff,” he managed to say before several blue rings hit him squarely in the chest.  He toppled over backwards and hit the floor.
 	
“Over there!” came Brixx’s voice.  Several pairs of boots began pounding their way.
 	
“So much for the element of surprise!” Dia said as the group spread out along the cards.  They rose and began exchanging shots with the oncoming pirates and troopers.  People nearby began screaming and trying to move out of the way.  The entire area erupted in chaos.
 	
“We can’t stay here,” said an actress with golden hair styled into ringlets to Dia.
 	
“Can’t argue there,” Dia said as she dropped a stormtrooper with a blaster shot. “I’m open to suggestions!”
 	
Reginald lowered himself behind the cart fully, deep in thought.  Suddenly, an idea struck him. 
 	
“We have to split up,” he said. 
 	
Dia ducked down behind the carts as the others continued to fire.
 	
“Why?” she asked.
 	
“If we split up, it would provide a distraction. I can take one group and lead them away, while you take the other and make your way to the bridge.”
 	
Dia thought about his plan.  It wasn’t the best idea to proceed forward with so few, but right now they didn’t have much of a choice.  If Reginald and his troupe was willing to take the risk, it may provide her with a small opening to draw troops and pirates out of her path.
 	
“Alright,” said Dia, looking at him. “It may be our only choice.  Whatever you do, rendezvous at the bridge as soon as you can.”
 	
Reginald nodded.
 	
“Take Mister Holden and Strong-armed Sally,” he said, pointing to a middle-aged man with dark hair and the woman with golden ringlets. “The rest of us will keep this group occupied.”
 	
The firing had momentarily stopped as the other crew members had finished shooting their opponents.  The troupe stood up.
 	
“Right this way, folks,” said Reginald, stepping out in front of the carts and waving for people to move past them.  The small groups of people wasted no time making their way towards them, while the troupe members pushed the carts out of the way to provide more room to move.  Suddenly, a door at the end of the opposite hallway burst open, revealing a pair of Aqualish and Arcona men, plus several other troopers. 
 	
“You there! Stop!”
 	
Reginald grabbed hold of one of the carts and began pushing it towards the new opponents. 
 	
“With me, men!” he called. “Forward! Forward!”
 	
A valiant cry arose from the troupe members as they moved down the hall behind Reginald, also using the second cart as cover.
 	
Dia just shook her head.
 	
“Actors,” she muttered as she and her two companions cut through the swath of people and made their way towards the bridge a few decks above them.

Andrew, Supriya, and BD-B2 stood in the stairwell, looking through the window to the hangar.  They could just make out the group of racing pilots and their guards.  Other stormtroopers milled about the hangar.
 	
“There’s maybe eight or ten that I can see,” he said quietly as they moved away from the window. “But there may be more.”
 	
Supriya nodded. “Rushing in there with blasters blazing isn’t the best plan,” she said. “We need to create a distraction.”
 	
Andrew looked down at BD-B2, who looked up at him and titled his head.
 	
“Think you want to work your magic, little buddy?” he asked.
 	
BD-B2 gave a few quick whoops and beeps, nodding his head.
 	
“Okay.  We’ll open the door and let you go first.  I need you to create some havoc.  Mess with one of the forklifts if you need to.  Create a distraction for us so we can take care of the troopers.  Understand?”
 	
The droid whistled an affirmative.  
 	
“What about us?” he asked Supriya.
 	
“I say we play up the fact that they need help on the decks above to track down two people causing disruptions,” she said.
 	
“Works for me,” he said.  He moved to the door and pressed the button.  It hissed open quietly, and BD-B2 carefully began to race his way across the deck, taking cover behind refuse bins or boxes and crates of material.  Andrew and Supriya walked out several seconds later, slowly making their way towards the group of stormtroopers.  
 	
It was then that he noticed more stormtroopers to their left, waiting by the freighters.  A lot more stormtroopers.
 	
“We’re in over our heads,” he said quietly into the comm to Supriya.
 	
“No turning back now,” she said. “Let me do all the talking.”
 	
As they came to the racing pilots on the ground, Andrew saw Ledwin and the other racers with their heads bowed low.
 	
“Who’s in charge here?” asked Supriya through the headset as they approached the group.
 	
The troopers exchanged glances. The closest one spoke up first. “Captain Connelly is,” he said. “He’s over there.”  The trooper pointed to the rows of stormtroopers a number of meters away from them.  One had the familiar orange shoulder-pad, indicating their status as the squad leader.
 	
“What’s the problem?” asked another trooper.
 	
“Word from the upper decks,” cut in Supriya smoothly. “Some runabouts on the loose causing havoc above.  We were ordered to come down and get more men to hunt them down.”
 	
Just then, some of the troopers led by Captain Connelly began to move, jogging towards the lift that would take them to the upper decks.  Captain Connelly, meanwhile, quickly made his way over to the group.
 	
“Orders from upstairs,” he said. “We need to reinforce our troops in the above decks to deal with some troublemakers.  Keep this hangar secure with the others.
 	
As Captain Connelly made his way to join the others, one of the stormtroopers near Andrew turned to look at his partner.
 	
“I don’t understand,” she said to the other trooper. “Why would they send two troopers down to report the need for help, then radio it in?”
 	
The troopers began to exchange glances as the door to the lift shut and the squad led by Connelly made their way up using the lift.  Then all eyes turned to Andrew and Supriya.  
 	
“What are your operating numbers?” one of them asked.
 	
“Uhh,” Andrew said.
 	
“Tee … Ex … dash … 1138 and 1139…,” Supriya said slowly.
 	
The troopers raised their blasters and made to fire.
 	
It was then that a series of screams came from the other end of the hangar.  A forklift was barrelling towards the troopers lined up near the freighter.  On that forklift was BD-B2, one foot on the wheel, another plugged into the operating console.
 	
“Lookout!” came cries from the troopers as they scattered.  Blaster fire erupted towards the forklift with little effect.  The droid was simply moving too fast for them to hit it with enough shots to stop it.
 	
Without wasting any more time, Andrew and Supriya raised their blasters and stunned the four troopers around the group of racers.  Each tore off their helmets.
 	
“Major!” cried Ledwin, looking up.
  	
“No time to talk, Ledwin,” Andrew said. “Get everyone to safety in the Lounge.  We’ll take it from here.”
 	
The group rose quickly and dashed towards the racer lounger while Andrew and Supriya took cover behind a pair of crates a few meters away.  They began exchanging shots with the troopers ahead of them.  BD-B2 spun the forklift around, then accelerated full throttle towards a pair of troopers.  They weren’t able to get out of the way in time, and were sent flying and screaming a number of feet away.
 	
“Watch the left side!” Supriya said as a trio of troopers rounded the left-most freighter.
 	
Andrew moved his blaster and began tracking them.  He was about to fire when a series of stun rings shot out from his left and hit all three troopers.  Ledwin slammed himself against the side of the crate next to Andrew. 
 	
“Need a hand?” he asked.
 	
“The more, the merrier!” he replied, tracking another trooper and firing towards him.
 	
The entire ordeal was over in a matter of minutes. BD-B2 took down the last of the troopers by pinning them with the forklift against a row of containers, piercing the metal siding.  The droid hopped down from the controls and scurried their way, hopping up and down and hooting in excitement.
 	
“Well now,” said Andrew. “I’d say after all this is taken care of, you might just have earned yourself a medal.” The droid hooted in agreement and whirled around in a circle. “Ledwin,” he said looking at the Duros, “we have to make contact with my ship in orbit.  The way to do that is with some of the racers.  Can you help us prep them?”
 	
The other racers had begun to exit the lounge and make their way over to the trio, seeing that fight was over.
 	
“We can,” he said, nodding, “though it will take a few minutes. What do we do with the troopers?”
 	
“Use their cuffs to bind them in case they wake up.  Keep them all in the same area,” Supriya said. “We’ll need to move quickly.”
 	
It took several minutes, but the group managed to round up and cuff all the troopers, deprive them of their weapons, plus prep two of the Z-95s for launch.  Andrew and Supriya had also stripped themselves of the stormtrooper armor into their regular clothes, and gathered two flight helmets.
 	
“Major,” said Ledwin over the noise of the engines as he took the ladder away from the Z-95.  Andrew looked over the side of the cockpit to see Ledwin give him a quick salute. “Good luck.”
	
“Thanks,” Andrew said, returning the salute. “Don’t forget to watch the lift and stairwell door.”
 	
“We will,” Ledwin said as the cockpit closed around him.  
 	
Pulling back on his stick, the Z-95 lifted off the deck.  Retracting his landing gear, he glanced over to Supriya, who gave him a quick nod of acknowledgement.  Pushing forward, his Z-95 began to exit the hangar, Supriya right behind him.  He flicked a few switches to begin charging his ion lasers and shields, just to be safe.
 	
“We’ll need to get some height,” he said as they cleared the hangar, “and connect with the right frequency.  Keep me covered.”
 	
“Copy that,” Supriya said as the two crafts rose and made their way towards the clouds as the sun was on its journey to set for the evening.
