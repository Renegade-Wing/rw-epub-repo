Chapter 13
:::
 	
<p>Dia carefully made her way down the walkway of the ship towards the theatre section, one hand on the railing to steady her balance.  Muffled but loud music and voices could be heard coming from the bow location ahead as the speakers relayed the actions of the play, and other cruise attendees made their way to or from the bow of the ship.  She was feeling well enough to get up and move around, though her stomach still made the odd somersault.  Having a light snack and liquids had helped her feel better, she was looking forward to spending time with Andrew despite her distaste for musicals -- though in fairness, it would be better than puking her guts out again.  She’d decided to trade in wearing a dress for once for a pair of navy dark pants and a long-sleeved dark green shirt, and a pair of thick-heeled ankle-high boots.  She felt out-of-place compared to the others around her but didn’t let it bother her.
 	
<p>As she got within thirty feet of the event entrance, she heard a low humming sound.  Screams and the faint sound of blaster fire erupted ahead of her.  Her attention was immediately caught by the sight of a sailing skiff rising up from the side of the ship.  Men and alien species armed with blasters began to jump off the skiff to prevent anyone else from leaving, as well as secure as many people as possible.  Women and men ahead of her yelled or gave screams of surprise or shock as they were cornered or hit with blue rings of stun lasers.
 	
<p>Her instincts kicking in, she began to double-back as best she could -- until she noticed a squad of Imperial stormtroopers coming up the deck behind her.
 	
<p>
    <i>Imperial troops, here?!</i>
    she thought.  <i>Gotta find some place safe.</i>
<p>Her options limited, she cut away to her left at a brisk pace and entered a small alcove that had a double-pair of stairs leading to the deck below.  As she descended the stairs, she placed a hand on her churning stomach.  She heard helmeted voices behind her.
 	
<p>“Squad A, move up and secure the bow.  Squads B and C, head down to the next deck and begin a sweep.”
 	
<p>With little choice, she rounded the first corner to her right and briskly made her way down the hall.  She could hear the clatter of boots against the metal stairway as the stormtroopers made their way down.  She tried the access pad of the first door she came to.  It didn’t open.
 	
<p>
    <i>Locked! Kriff!</i>
<p>She tried the second, with no luck.  The third door read maintenance and opened easily as her hand pressed the access pad.  The door hissed open to reveal a young male janitor prepping some cleaning gear.  He gave her a puzzled look as she pressed the interior keypad, effectively locking the door behind her.
 	
<p>“Hey,” he began, “you’re not supposed to--”
 	
<p>She met him within three quick steps and cupped her hand around his mouth.
 	
<p>“Quiet!” she hissed. “Or they’ll hear you.”
 	
<p>The janitor was about to say something else but stopped when a rap came at the door.
 	
<p>“This one’s locked,” came a voice from the other side. “Keep moving, go go go.”
 	
<p>As the sound of boots quickly faded, Dia let out a short breath and slowly removed her hand from the young man’s mouth.
 	
<p>“How did you?... Who are you?” he asked quietly, a bewildered look on his face.
 	
<p>“My name’s Dia Tann,” she said in a low voice.  Her stomach churned, harder this time. “I’m an officer with the New Republic here on shore leave.  I don’t know what’s going on, but pirates and stormtroopers have somehow made their way onto the ship.”  The janitor’s mouth dropped open in wonder and concern. 
 	
<p>“How many are there?” he asked.
 	
<p>“I don’t know.  But what I do know is that if we want to get out of this in one piece, I need to contact our ships in orbit.” She quickly glanced at his uniform.  The name tag read ‘Rim’.  She met his eyes.  “Rim, I need your help.  Can you help me?”
 	
<p>He nodded his head after a moment, surprised at this ask for help.
 	
<p>“Good.  Do you know the ship well?  Do you have a map or technical layout?”
 	
<p>“Nothing too technical,” he said, walking back to a small display screen at the back of the room set between two shelving units full of cleaning supplies. “But there is a general layout of the ship.  What exactly do you--?”
 	
<p>Her stomach lurched.  She dashed for the large square wash sink to her left, emptying the contents of her stomach.
 	
<p>“Are you okay?” he asked.
 	
<p>“I’ll be fine,” she said, wiping her mouth before vomiting again. “Just give me a second,” she gasped.  She twisted the handle to activate the water flow, and scooped a few handfuls into her mouth to rinse it and her esophagus of the acid.  Oddly enough, she felt a bit better.  “Okay … okay, Rim. What can you tell me?” she asked as she stood up and walked over to the first rung of the shelving.  Rim pressed a button, and the decks of the ship sprung to life.
 	
<p>“We’re here,” he said, pointing to a glowing red dot on the screen.  “Security is located on Deck 5 in the midsection.”
 	
<p>“Great,” she said, “only three decks down.  What’s the easiest way to get there?”
 	
<p>“More like the not-so-easy path,” he said, some concern spreading across his face. “If Imperial troops are sweeping the halls, there aren’t many places you can hide.”  He pressed a button and the view changed to show a top-down perspective of the blueprint.  “Main dining halls are on decks three and four.”
 	
<p>“Which they’ll probably be ferrying the crew and passengers to,” she said. “Which means there will be constant movement in those areas.”
 	
<p>“And also means that you could be caught.  Easiest way to Security from here is to use the access lifts.  It’s what we use to move supplies and carts.  If you use the one on this level, you can go down a few decks and make your way across the ship to this access lift here.”  He pointed to one half-way down on deck eight. “If you take this one, it’ll place you very close to security.”
 	
<p>“It’s risky,” she said, shaking her head. “But I don’t have much choice.  What about the bridge?”
 	
<p>“Easiest way there is taking the access lift on deck four up to deck one.  You avoid the stairwells.  Wouldn’t the bridge be a priority target, though?”
 	
<p>“It would be,” she said, trying to think the plan through. “But that depends on whether or not they want to steer the ship.  Regardless, it’s the only place to broadcast a signal.”
 	
<p>“There’s that,” he said with a shrug. “Or you can use one of the racers in the hangar.  They have long-range radios, don’t they?”
 	
<p>She loved the idea, but also realized other potential issues with it.
 	
<p>“They could, but if any Imperial transports landed down there, they’ll be safely guarded.  There’s no way to be certain.”
 	
<p>Rim shot her a concerned look. “It’s dangerous either way,” he said.
 	
<p>“I know,” she replied, nodding. “But if we want to get out of this, I have to try.”  She turned to make her way back to the door.
 	
<p>“Wait,” he said. “What do you want me to do?”
 	
<p>She turned to look at him. “It will be safer for you here.  Keep that door locked, and don’t let anyone in until this is over.”  
 	
<p>“One more thing,” he said, fishing in his pocket and walking over to her. “Here, take this.”
 	
<p>He handed her a thin, flat access card with a serial number on it.  “It’s my access card.  Will get you into any lift or maintenance room you need to.”
 	
<p>“Thank you, Rim,” she added, taking the card. He nodded in acknowledgement. 
 	
<p>She opened the door and stuck her head out, checking that the hallway was clear.  It was. 
 	
<p>“Stay safe!” he said as she exited the room. 
 	
<p>Her stomach no longer bothering her, she turned right, towards the screams coming from down the hall.


<p>***


 	
<p>Peeking around the corner, Andrew checked to ensure that the coast was clear.  He and Supriya had been able to avoid two pairs of Imperial troops earlier.  They hadn’t been so lucky with the third one, though had managed to elude them by ducking into a lavatory room that was conveniently around a corner.
 	
<p>“Okay,” he said quietly, turning back to her.  “Coast is clear.”
 	
<p>“Good.  Where are we now?”
 	
<p>He searched for the small white plaque with black and red lettering that they’d been using for directions.
 	
<p>“Uhh … deck four, midsection.  Security is one deck below us.  I think.”
 	
<p>“You think?” she asked, raising an eyebrow.
 	
<p>“I don’t exactly have a map!” he hissed. “I’ve just been following the signs!”
 	
<p>Rolling her eyes, she walked past him and followed the numbers on the doors.  Screams and shouts echoed from somewhere near them.
 	
<p>“Quickly now,” she said.  “We don’t have much--”
 	
<p>The emergency exit door to her left slid open, revealing two Imperial stormtroopers.  Their appearance had caught her off guard.
 	
<p>“Freeze!” said one trooper stepping out of the doorway and raising her blaster. “Don’t--aaugh!” 
 	
<p>Andrew barrelled himself into the trooper as hard as he could, knocking her over.  Before the second trooper could fire a shot at him, Supriya grabbed hold of him, wrestling him back into the emergency exit stairwell. 
 	
<p>Andrew, meanwhile, grabbed his stormtrooper by the collar of her armor and began bouncing her off the wall. 
 	
<p>
    “I’m really sorry for this,” he said. <i>Thwack.</i>
    “I don’t enjoy hitting women.” <i>Thwack.  Thwack.</i>
    “But you’re a stormtrooper, and you’re in my way!” <i>Thwack!</i>
    The stormtrooper slumped to the floor in daze, dropping her blaster.  He scrambled to pick it up from near her, took a step back to check the setting, and fired.  A blue ring of energy lanced forth and hit the trooper, stunning her.  He heard a similar shot come from the stairwell, and checked on Supriya.  She had similarly stunned her trooper, who lay slumped against the wall.
 	
<p>“They won’t be out for long,” he said to her quietly.  Then he reached for and began dragging his trooper into the stairwell.
 	
<p>“I know,” she replied.  “But we don’t have anywhere to hide them either.”
 	
<p>Andrew looked at the two unconscious troopers and their gear.  Then he looked at the railing with its vertical bars to his right.
 	
<p>“I have an idea,” he said. “Get their cuffs.”  
	
<p>They propped both of the troopers up against the railing, and raised their arms up.  Reaching through the bars, he fastened them together at the wrists.  
 	
<p>“They won’t be moving anywhere soon,” he said, plucking the personal communicators and cuff keys from their belts.
 	
<p>“Or calling for help,” she said, removing their helmets and placing them on the stairs, which would be well out of arm or leg reach.
 	
<p>
    Andrew quickly checked the stairwell above and below them.  He didn’t see or hear anyone coming.  Then he noticed the stairwell sign.  <i>Deck 5 Below</i>
    it read.
 	
<p>“This may be our best chance,” he whispered.
 	
<p>“Agreed,” she said with a nod.  “Let’s go.  Quietly this time.”
 	
<p>He nodded, and they slowly began to move down the stairwell as quietly as they could.  When they reached the bottom, Supriya moved towards the keypad, readying to press it.  Andrew lowered his blaster, which she readied hers.
 	
<p>“On three,” she whispered. “One … two … three,” she pressed the button.  
 	
<p>The door slid open.
 	
<p>He moved right.
 	
<p>She moved left.
 	
<p>The hallway was clear.
 	
<p>“Lucky us,” she said with a sigh. 
 	
<p>“Agreed.”
 	
<p>“Security’s this way,” she said, motioning with her blaster to the sign on the wall. “Come on.”
