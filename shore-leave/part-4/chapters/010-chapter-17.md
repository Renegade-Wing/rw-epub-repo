Chapter 17
:::
 	
Dia watched as the squad of death troopers and a woman in an Imperial captain’s uniform appeared around the corner of the far side of the deck.  The stormtrooper captain that had captured Dia and her compatriots briskly walked over to greet them.  She couldn’t hear all of what was being said, but she didn’t need to leave much to the imagination with the shouts and blaster fire in the distance, not to mention the four TIE Fighters plummeting into the water around the ship.  She saw the trooper captain nod several times, then touch his hand to his helmet.  Most of the stormtroopers in the area began to stream towards one of the pathways along the deck and head towards the commotion, leaving only a few -- including a good number of the pirates -- to guard the crew and passengers being held prisoner.
 	
One of the docked freighters began to close its hatch, its cargohold full of people, and when it was sealed the freighter took off while another one took its place.  The death troopers and the Imperial officer were the first to board this one.  She heard the echo of blaster shots from inside the ship.  Shortly thereafter the ramp began to raise and it took off at full speed away from the ship.
	

_Typical Imperial cowardice_ she thought as she heard blaster fire getting closer and closer.
 	
“You three,” said a stormtrooper as he walked over to them, blaster pointed. “Stand up and get in line.  Move!”
 	
With little choice, the trio did as he commanded. They moved step by step with those ahead of them, though it was still taking time to lift up and load people and beings on to the transports.  By the time she had moved half-way up the line with the others, she heard a cacophony of sounds.  Some were shouts, while others were the distinct sounds of engines. The moaning roar of eight TIE Fighters could be heard in the distance as they approached at full speed towards the ship.
 	
“Look!” someone near her called. “Up in the sky!”
 	
Looking up, she saw the distinct profiles of a group of X-wings and A-wings barreling towards them, S-foils locked in attack position.
 	
“Who was able to call them?” asked Holden beside her.
 	
“I have a good idea who,” said Dia with a smile.

“This is Rogue Leader,” said Reynolds as the fighters dove towards the ship. “Engage the eyeballs.  Watch your fire around the ship.”
 	
“Copy, Rogue Leader,” came a string of replies.
 	
The fighters finished their dive and leveled off, racing across the body of the ship, pouring a slough of red laser fire at the oncoming TIE Fighters.  They, in turn, fired back with green lasers.
 	
The two parties clashed, breaking off and maneuvering to engage one another.
 	
“Rogue Leader this is Corsair Leader,” came Syntax’s mechanical voice on the radio.
 	
“Go ahead, Corsair Leader,” Reynolds said.
 	
“Looks like those transports are being loaded with the ship’s crew.  They don’t look friendly.”
 	
“Copy that,” said Reynolds, banking his craft right and sending a hail of fire into a TIE Fighter.  It exploded brilliantly against the evening sky. “Rogue Five, Rogue Six, pursue and disable any fleeing freighters.”

As the starfighters engaged in combat overhead, lighting up the night sky, Dia heard the shouting grow even louder.  She turned to see a large group of people led by Reginald come pouring around the corner, blasters and props raised to meet the stormtroopers and pirates alike.
 	
“For victory!” she heard him cry.
 	
The entire deck erupted into a chaotic mess of shouts, screams, and people trying to get out of the way or attack and defend.  Using the chaos to her advantage she turned and body-checked the trooper behind her with her full weight, sending him to the deck.  For good measure, she kicked him twice.
 	
“Lady Dia!” Reginald said as he made his way to her. “Are you all right?”
 	
“I will be once you get me out of these bindings,” she said.  He switched the blaster to fire mode and shot the cuffs apart, freeing her hands.  He did the same for Holden and Sally.  Dia stooped down and picked up the blaster from the trooper she had knocked down, then stunned him for good measure.  Blaster fire continued to erupt in every direction around them.  Some people were stunned, while others were shot dead where they stood.
 	
“Time to join the party,” she said with a smirk, and began firing at what targets she could.
 	
“You know,” said Reginald, hitting a pirate that had approached them over the head with his cutlass prop. “Fighting fictional pirates on the theatre stage is one thing.  But I have to say, fighting real pirates is much more exhilarating!”
 	
Dia could only laugh at this comment as she downed another target, and the sky above erupted into more explosions as the TIE Fighters were cut down one by one.

Solari moved forward as quickly as he could, one hand holding his blaster, the other guiding Suli forward.  She continued to make noises through her gag, but he ignored them.  The service lift was just up ahead.  If he could get there, he knew he would stand a better chance of being able to flee safely.  Anything after that he would have to fix himself.
 	
The light above the service elevator lit up, and the doors whisked open to reveal two individuals and a droid standing in the middle.
 	
“Solari?” asked Major Dobson. “What are you…?”
 	
A lie ran through Solari’s mind.
 	
“Good to see you, Major,” he said, coming to a stop. “Pirates and Imperials have taken over the ship. I’m seeing that Miss deChenzzi gets off the ship safely.”
 	
“Then why is she bound and gagged?” he asked.  
 	
“Ah, about that,” Solari said, “it’s a very complicated matter.  Best to get her to a safe location first lest we be found by our enemies.”
 	
He watched as Dobson glanced at the woman next to him.  The droid near his feet gave a titter of beeps.
 	
“I’d say she’s in good company now.  Wouldn’t you agree, Suli?” he asked.
 	
Suli nodded her head quickly several times.  Solari saw the dark-skinned woman next to the Major lift her blaster.
 	
“Major’s right,” she said. “Here is as good a place as any.”
 	
Solari gave a sigh and lifted his blaster to point it at the two of them.
 	
“I don’t want to do this,” he said, panic beginning to rise in his voice. “But I need to get off this ship.  No harm will come to her, of that I can promise.”  He slowly moved his blaster from one target to another.  “But you need to step out of the lift and let us pass.”
 	
He saw the Major raise his blaster. 
 	
“I don’t believe you,” he said.
 	
Solari cleared his throat and met the eyes of the Major directly. 
 	
“A Solari never wavers from their commitment,” he said intently.  Solari was about to pull the trigger when he felt the distinct heel of one of Suli’s shoes jam into the top of his foot.  He gave a cry of pain, then felt himself being knocked backwards with Suli’s weight.  It was enough to send him toppling backwards, and he let go of Suli to reach for something to keep his balance.  As he hit the floor, a stun ring hit his blaster arm.
 	
“No!” he spat as his arm went numb and limp.  He grabbed the blaster with his free hand and began to clamour backwards as best he could.  The Major and his friend raced forward; he to take care of Suli, and she to get to Solari.  He scrambled to fire two shots, one of which missed.  The other hit her shoulder.  She let out a cry of pain, but kept moving forward. She made to kick him once, but his years of athleticism and training saw him kick the leg she was using as support out from under her.  She collapsed partly on top of him, and partly on the floor.
 	
As Solari heard several blaster shots in front of him, he saw the bindings and cuffs being broken free of Suli.  Solari raised his blaster again and was about to fire when the woman’s hands reached up and grabbed hold of his blaster arm.  The two began to grunt as they wrestled.  His finger unintentionally hit the trigger of the blaster, sending blind shots in any direction the blaster was pointed.  He heard someone yell in pain.
 	
“Drop it,” spat the woman grappling with him. She began to bash his hand against the wall. “Drop it!”
 	
Solari intentionally let go of the blaster.  A tingling sensation in his other arm indicated that he was getting some of the feeling back, and with all his effort he clenched his first and swung his numb arm into his attacker while grabbing onto her with his good arm and rolling to the side.  She bounced into the wall, dropping her blaster, and he broke away from her.  
 	
As he stood up, quickly grabbing her blaster, he was tackled from behind. He hit the floor again and rolled to meet his new attacker.  It was Dobson. 
 	
“You don’t know when to quit,” he spat as he began to grapple with Dobson.  It was difficult with his numb arm, but he used his strength to his advantage.  The man was able to get a clear punch or two into Solari’s solar plexus, but Solari used his good arm to reach for the Major’s throat.  As he grabbed the Major’s flesh of his throat, he squeezed and began to choke him. The Major’s body began to go limp, and he clawned at Solari’s hand to try and pry it away.  Rising up, Solari slammed Dobson into the side of the wall three times before his body went limp.  
 	
As the Major slumped to the floor, Solari reached for one of the E-11 blasters and grabbed ahold of it.  He fired a shot into the Major’s body, though it was not what he had intended.  Instead of a red-orange blaster bolt, a ring of blue energy hit the man.  Solari made to flip the setting of the blaster to kill when he felt a tentacle wrap around the wrist of the arm his blaster was holding.  Immeasurable pain shot through his arm as the grip tightened and he dropped the blaster with a cry.  Three more tentacles grabbed hold of his body and whipped him around -- to face Suli.
 	
“Hello, Korwin,” she said, arms crossed and fire burning in her eyes.
 	
“Suli,” he said frantically as one of her tentacles moved to wrap around his throat. “I can explain!” he gasped as it began to squeeze his neck.
  	
He felt her shift her body, and the last thing he remembered was him being pulled towards her quickly while her knuckled fist connected with his face.
