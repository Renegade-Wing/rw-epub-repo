Chapter 16
:::
 	
<p>Solari walked out into the fresh evening air aboard the main deck of the SS Starfish.  His personal shuttle was waiting for him on the landing pad some distance away.  Lines of people streamed down each side of the ship’s deck towards the gathering area, pirates and stormtroopers standing guard.  Suli exited a few moments later, her mouth gagged.  She was flanked by Miguel and the stormtroopers from the room earlier.  
 	
<p>He heard the distinct whine of a shuttle approaching, and the low scream of four Imperial TIE Fighters in the distance.  Gaspra was about to land.
 	
<p>“Wait here, sir,” said one of the stormtroopers.  Solari nodded in acknowledgement.
 	
<p>As the lambda-class shuttle landed on the landing pad in front of them, the four TIE Fighters continued their slow escort before breaking off into pairs to maintain a patrol pattern around the ship.  He watched as the ramp to the shuttle hissed open and lowered.  A squadron of death troopers marched down the ramp and set up a protective perimeter.  Behind them, Captain Gaspra strode down the deck, four regular stormtroopers in tow. She looked different in person than her hologram did.
 	
<p>Her eyes were a cold piercing grey. Her raven-black hair was cut short, but neatly and appropriately for her grey Imperial captain’s hat and uniform.  Her face was youthful and collected, almost as if she could pose for a beauty agency.  But it was her cold, grey eyes that caught his attention.  They were like piercing daggers as she looked at him.
 	
<p>“Solari,” she said with a nod, greeting him.
 	
<p>“Captain Gaspra,” he nodded in exchange. “Welcome aboard.”
 	
<p>“How goes the operation?” she asked tersely.
 	
<p>“We’ve begun loading the transports as requested,” he said. “Though with a ship of such a size, moving the people on board will take time. We may need more ships.”
 	
<p>“Ships that we can’t afford to bring,” said Gaspra coldly, “lest we want to arouse suspicion.  I’m taking a risk being here personally, Solari.”
	
<p>“I understand, captain,” Solari said coolly, maintaining his composure. “Though I am sure that with the added workforce, we can meet your … ambitious targets.”
 	
<p>Gaspra glanced behind Solari to see Miguel and Suli.
 	
<p>“And what of these two?” she asked.
 	
<p>“Captain Miguel has been rather helpful with the entire situation.  If you have, in fact, captured his family, I see no reason why they should not be released.  As for Miss deChenzzi, I will take full responsibility for her and see that she is taken care of.”  
 	
<p>“Once we are done here,” she said, “that can easily be arranged.  As for Miss deChenzzi, she will be sent to the mines.”
 	
<p>Korwin took a few steps forward, his brow narrowing
 	
<p>“The mines are no place for her,” he said emphatically, “and if she disappears it will cause disruption in the markets, and to the tourism industry.”	
	
<p>“Small disruptions do not concern me, Mister Solari,” Gaspa said. “She knows too much, and needs to be taken care of.  I am sure that once she is on board the Monarch we can come to a mutual understanding.”  Suli began to make some noises in protest. A stormtrooper next to her hit her with the butt of his blaster to make her stop.
 	
<p>“That was never part of our agreement,” Solari said, taking a few more steps forward.  Two of the death troopers raised their blasters, causing Solari to stop short.
 	
<p>“It wasn’t,” said Gaspra, “but circumstances have changed.”
 	
<p>Korwin clenched his fists and was about to give a rebuttal when he heard the engines of two ships from somewhere ahead of him.  He looked up to see two Z-95s making a break for the clouds while the TIE Fighters continued to circle overhead.  Gaspra turned around just in time to witness what Solari saw.
 	
<p>“You’re right, Captain,” he said as she turned back to look at him. “Circumstances have certainly changed.”


<p>***


 	
<p>Dia crouched as she exited the stairwell to the second deck with Holden and Sally, blaster in hand.
 	
<p>“Look,” said Holden, pointing up and across the deck from them. “There’s the bridge.”
 	
<p>“Finally,” Dia said.
 	
<p>They began to make their way across the deck, being careful to use what cover they could to avoid detection.  When they were about half-way across the deck, she heard the sound of an Imperial shuttle and four TIE Fighters behind her.  The noises were loud for a moment, then trailed off as the fighters moved away and the shuttle landed.
 	
<p>“We have to hurry,” she said. “We don’t have--”
 	
<p>“There’s three!” came a stormtrooper's voice from behind them.
 	
<p>The trio whirled around to see a pair of stormtroopers standing at the top of the stairwell they had come up, and had begun to fire shots at them.
 	
<p>“Sithspit,” Dia cursed as she grabbed a nearby table and flipped it over.  The three took cover behind the table.  Several shots hit the table, inching it backwards.
 	
<p>“I’ll take these two,” said Holden. “You two get to the bridge!”
 	
<p>Dia and Sally nodded and made a break for the bridge while Holden used the table for cover and fired at the two stormtroopers.  They were just about to the stairwell leading up to the bridge when another pair of stormtroopers rounded the corner.  Sally fired a shot at one trooper, dropping him where he stood, and then began to grapple with the second.  It wasn’t difficult to see why Reginald had called her Strong-armed Sally.
 	
<p>“Go!” she called as she threw the stormtrooper against the side of the railing.  Two more rounded the corner.
 	
<p>Dia fired a shot, dropping one trooper, while she raced for the stairs and bound up them two steps at a time.  She saw two Z-95s take off from the stern of the ship as she was about to round the stairwell.  It took her a few more sets of stairs before she was able to get to the bridge door.  Pressing the access panel button, the door whisked open.  Smoke began to pour out of the doorway.  Her eyes stung from the surprise, and she coughed a few times, but went in anyway -- only to see that a number of the control panels were destroyed.  Sparks flew out of two of them.
 	
<p>“No,” she said between coughs, trying to find the radio. “No, no, no!”  
 	
<p>She found it a few seconds later.  Its screen was cracked, and the main console had several shots riddling it.
 	
<p>“Freeze!” came a voice behind her.  She whirled around to see three stormtroopers enter the room, one of which had an orange shoulder pad on, blasters drawn. “Don’t move!”
 	
<p>
    <i>Karabast!</i>
    she cursed to herself.  
 	
<p>“Lower your weapon. Slowly.”
 	
<p>She lowered her weapon to the floor, then made to kneel and placed her hands behind her head.  There was no escape for her now.


<p>***
 	
<p>Captain Quelle sat in his chair on the bridge of the Vigilant, coordinating the repair and reload operations.  It had been a busy few days since they had arrived at the dockyard.  A full assessment had finally been done, and while some progress had been made to repair the cruiser, other issues had begun to crop up.  What was more problematic was that some decks were off-limits due to the multiple hull breaches the ship had suffered, which caused the flow of personnel and repair materials to get held up at certain junctions as the personnel moved about.
 	
<p>“Captain,” came a voice from behind him. It was the comms officer.
 	
<p>“Yes, lieutenant?” he asked, not looking up from his data pad.
 	
<p>“It’s Major Dobson, sir,” he said. “Calling with an urgent message for you.”
 	
<p>
    <i>The Major’s supposed to be on vacation</i>
    he thought as he swiveled the chair around. <i>What could he want?</i>
<p>“Put him through, lieutenant,” he said.  Andrew’s helmet-clad face appeared on the holographic communicator.
 	
<p>“Captain Quelle!” said Andrew. “I’m glad that we were able to finally make contact with you.”
 	
<p>“What seems to be the problem, Major?” the captain asked. “Shouldn’t you be enjoying the sand on the beaches?”
 	
<p>“Would that I could, sir,” said Andrew, “but the Empire is here on Eudora.”
 	
<p>“The Empire?” the captain asked. “How do you mean?”
	
<p>“It’s difficult to explain,” said Andrew, “but Imperial stormtroopers and pirates have taken control of the cruise ship I was on.  Captain Supriya is with me, and we have taken control of two modified Z-95 racers to reach out to you.  I believe this is part of a larger issue in the region…”
 	
<p>“TIE Fighters, incoming!” came Supriya’s voice over his headset.  Quell was just able to make out this news and her voice.
 	
<p>“I have to go, sir,” Andrew said, checking behind him. “Please, send as much help as you can!  Dobson out.”
 	
<p>His holographic face disappeared.  Several crew members looked to the captain in surprise of this news.
 	
<p>“Tactical,” called the captain, “scramble the remaining pilots of Rogue and Corsair Squadrons immediately.  Have commandos and medics loaded into Sabre Flight.  I want a flight and security team down to Major Dobson’s location as soon as possible.”
 	
<p>“Yes, sir!”
 	
<p>
    “Lieutenant,” he said to the comms officer. “Get me the <i>Sovereignty</i>
    , now!”


<p>***


 	
<p>“Imperial forces on Eudora,” came the voice over the loudspeakers in the hangar. “Scramble Rogue and Corsair Squadrons! Scramble Rogue and Corsair Squadrons!”
 	
<p>Lieutenant Colonel Reynolds’s boots pounded across the metal deck plating of the hangar as he exited the hallway leading to the flight equipment room.  The remaining members of Rogue and Corsair weren’t far behind him, running as fast as they could.
 	
<p>As they reached their fighters, he noticed squads of commandos and medical personnel bolting for the U-wings on the other end of the hangar.
 	
<p>Grabbing onto the metal rungs of the red ladder, he hauled himself into his X-wing as his astromech was being loaded into its socket. 	He began flicking buttons, powering on his ship and beginning the pre-flight check.  All systems were go.  Lowering the canopy of his fighter, he looked to the flight crew members to each side.  They gave the signals that his craft was prepped and fueled.  Giving each a thumbs up, they backed away.  He pulled back on his stick, the X-wing rising off the deck.  Maneuvering to face the hangar exit, his craft smoothly made its way forward and passed through the blue magfield.
 	
<p>“Form up,” he said into his headset as the rest of the fighters joined him.
 	
<p>A string of affirmatives spilled over his headset.
 	
<p>
    “Rogue Leader, <i>Vigilant</i>
    ,” came Captain Quelle’s voice.
 	
<p>“Go ahead, captain.”
 	
<p>“Coordinates are being sent to you and your flight for rendezvous at Major Dobson’s location. Imperial TIE Fighters are present, and you are free to engage without discretion.  Be wary of any civilians in the area.  U-wings will launch with troops to reclaim the cruise ship shortly.”
 	
<p>“Affirmative, sir,” said Reynolds. “Alright, you heard the man ladies and gents.  Set throttle to full.  We have a vacation to rescue.”
 	

<p>***


 	
<p>Putting their crafts into a spinning roll, Andrew and Supriya raced forward, narrowly avoiding the incoming fire from the pair of TIE Fighters climbing to greet them.  Taking them head-on would normally have been suicide in a Z-95, but at this moment they didn’t have much of a choice.  The four craft miraculously avoided one another.
 	
<p>“They’re coming around,” Supriya said as she glanced over her shoulder.  
 	
<p>“I see them,” Andrew said, checking his six. “You break right, I’ll go left.  Bracket them on the way by.”
 	
<p>“Copy,” she said.
 	
<p>Andrew cut his stick to the left while using his free hand to rebalance his shields to a forward position.  As he completed his turn, seeing Supriya’s fighter complete hers as well, the two TIE Fighters split apart a mere second before they were able to fire.
 	
<p>“I’ll take the high one,” he said, “you go for the low one.”
 	
<p>As the four fighters continued their dance, Supriya arced and dove down towards her TIE Fighter, ion lasers firing, while Andrew continued to climb after his.  Suddenly, his TIE Fighter spun around and plummeted downwards in one swift movement.
 	
<p>“Karabast,” Andrew cursed, changing his course again. “Watch your six!”
 	
<p>Supriya looked over her shoulder, seeing the bolts of green laser blasts coming toward her.  She rolled her craft and broke right.  Andrew continued his dive, closing ground on the two TIEs.
 	
<p>“Watch yourself!” Supriya said as she formed up on his wing.  
 	
<p>Glancing to his eleven o’clock left, two more TIE Fighters burst through the thick cloud cover around them, lasers firing.
 	
<p>“Gah!” he said, twisting away.  A laser blast clipped his shields, causing them to drop significantly.  He dumped some laser energy into them and continued his maneuvers.
 	
<p>“We have to get out of this cloud cover,” Supriya said as she cut left to stay with Andrew.
 	
<p>“Agreed,” Andrew said, quickly trying to find all four TIE Fighters.  He only noticed three of them. “Let’s hit the deck, get on a level playing field.”
 	
<p>“Music to my ears,” Supriya said. “Setting shields to rear, full power to engines.”  Andrew did the same.
 	
<p>
    The two Z-95s rocketed downwards, putting themselves into a full spin.  As they burst through the cloud cover, the dimly lit ocean and the <i>Starfish</i>
    lay below them.  Behind them, the TIE Fighters were just out of direct distance, but that didn’t stop them from firing.  Both Z-95s kept spinning so as to not permit the TIEs to have a lock.
 	
<p>“Five thousand meters,” Supriya counted. “Four thousand … three thousand….”
 	
<p>“Pull up hard at one-hundred meters,” he said, “then boost your engines.”
 	
<p>“Two thousand … one thousand ….”
 	
<p>
    At five-hundred meters they stopped their spin. At one hundred meters they both leveled off and booster their engines, which caused both of them to be shifted backwards in their seats.  Green laser blasts splashed against the water behind them.  By the time they had leveled off, they were mere meters above the ocean, the speed of their craft pushing against the water and sending it flying in a spray behind them.  The <i>Starfish</i>
    was dead ahead.
 	
<p>
    “Care to try a fancy maneuver?” he asked.  The <i>Starfish</i>
    began to loom closer.
 	
<p>“It’s risky, but worth a shot.”
 	
<p>“I’ll cut high right, you cut low left.  Drift when you get to the stern and do a one-eighty.  We’ll cut across the mid-section where the landing pads are, and hit the TIEs on each side.”
 	
<p>He rolled his Z-95 over hers, the two craft cutting towards their side of the ship.  Giving full power to the engines and shifting his shielding forward once more, he raced along the side of the ship.  He could just make out lines and pockets of people on the deck.
 	
<p>“Get ready,” he said as he approached the stern. “Now!”
 	
<p>The two Z-95s met at the front of the ship, one above the other to avoid a collision. Moving as one, they cut their throttles and began to drift, sliding around the front of the ship at an angle. 
 	
<p>“Boosting now,” he heard her say over the comm.
 	
<p>As the two Z-95s leapt forward, he could see that the TIE Fighters were still paired together, a set coming down the ship’s left or right side.
 	
<p>“Get ready,” he said as their crafts raced towards the incoming laser fire. “Now!”
 	
<p>He cut hard to the left and nearly buzzed the deck below him as he crossed the mid-section.  Supriya was but a second behind him.  As the two Z-95s cut across their paths, blue ion bolts lanced forward to the two pairs of TIE Fighters, hitting one in each pair.  A TIE Fighter on each side surged with electric energy and remained mid-air momentarily before plunging into the ocean below.
 	
<p>“Splash two!” Supriya called with a hoot of enthusiasm.


<p>***


 	
<p>Dia, Holden, and Sally marched with their hands cuffed forward, a pair of stormtroopers on either side of them.  It wasn’t long before they were taken to where the transports were being loaded.
 	
<p>“Come on, come on!” growled one of the pirates nearby to a group of people being ushered onto one of the ramps. “We haven’t got all day.”  The cargo freighters hovered near the edge of the ship, their ramps having crushed the nearby railing.
 	
<p>“Kneel,” ordered the stormtrooper behind her.  When she didn’t immediately reply, he repeated the order and struck her in the back with the butt of his blaster. “I said kneel!”
 	
<p>Her back aching, she begrudgingly knelt.
 	
<p>“Guess that’s in then,” said Holden quietly.
 	
<p>She was about to say something when she heard two Z-95s roar past the sides of the ship.
 	
<p>“Hopefully,” she said, glancing at Holden, “not just yet.” 


<p>***

 	
<p>Solari and those around him ducked as the two Z-95s roared overhead, lasers blasting away.  Seconds later, two TIE Fighters plummeted into the ocean.  A roar of cheers rose from the civilians on either side of the deck, and elsewhere on the ship.
 	
<p>“Well now, it looks like that would be my exit call,” Gaspra said, turning back to look at the stormtroopers behind her. “Put deChenzzi in my shuttle, then prepare for takeoff.”
 	
<p>“No,” she heard Solari say behind her.  She turned to see a blaster pointed at her.  The blasters of the troopers in the general vicinity clicked as they were raised and pointed at Solari. “She’s coming with me.”
 	
<p>Gaspra raised an eyebrow and gave a mirthless scoff.
 	
<p>“Really, Solari?” she asked. “Whatever do you think you could possibly do here?”
	
<p>Before either one could continue, the sound of footsteps came echoing up the stairwell.  A mixed group of people, some looking like elaborately dressed actors, others like cruise goers, charged up the stairs and onto the deck.
 	
<p>
    “For the <i>Starfish</i>
    !” yelled the lead man in a rich overcoat and large fedora with a feather in it.  His followers echoed a similar sentiment or simply yelled.
 	
<p>The stormtroopers were shocked only for a moment at this surprise, but it was long enough for Miguel to tackle the trooper nearest him. Blaster fire began to erupt between the two parties, but it wasn’t long before the stormtroopers and death troopers were locked in hand-to-hand combat with their new attackers.  Chaos erupted on the deck.
 	
<p>“Leave her,” Gaspra ordered as she began to make her way backwards, the stormtroopers shielding her.  She was mere meters away from the ramp of her shuttle when she heard an overbearing scream come towards her.  She turned to see a TIE Fighter spinning out of control, and a Z-95 with a smoking engine breaking away.  As she dropped to the deck, the TIE Fighter hit the shuttle with enough force to send it moving.
 	
<p>Anyone in the general area scrambled to get out of the path of the two ships.  The lambda shuttle tipped over onto its side, pinning Solari’s shuttle, while the TIE Fighter kept bouncing along the deck until it cleared the railing and plummeted into the ocean below.  
 	
<p>Gaspra stared in disbelief, mouth agape, at the condition of her shuttle.  Blaster fire and shouts rang out around her.
 	
<p>“Ma’am,” said one of the death troopers in a garbled voice, helping her up. “We have to go.  There are transports nearby.”
 	
<p>Rising from the deck, Gaspra began to make her way forward, death troopers in tow shielding her.  Amidst the chaos, and as the final TIE Fighter plummeted into the ocean, the last she saw of Solari, he had taken hold of Suli and was leading her somewhere in the other direction. 
 	

<p>***


 	
<p>Andrew struggled to maintain a leveled approach as his Z-95 made its way towards the opening of the hangar at the rear of the ship. Black smoke streamed from his port side engine on the craft.
 	
<p>“Come on, baby, hold together,” he said as his craft bobbed from side to side.  Gritting his teeth, he began the landing sequence, pulling his nose up as best he could.  The Z-95 bounced a few times as it hit the deck just inside the entrance and slid to a stop not far from the three freighters parked ahead.  Supriya landed past them several seconds later.  
  	
<p>Powering down his systems and engines, he opened the canopy.  Hanging on to the ledge of the Z-95, he lowered himself over the side and dropped the last few feet onto the deck.  As he rounded the nose of the craft, he saw Ledwin racing towards him.
 	
<p>“Are you all right?” Ledwin asked.
 	
<p>“Yeah,” Andrew said, “though something should be done about that engine.
 	
<p>“I’ll take care of it,” Ledwin said.  “Go see the others!”
 	
<p>He took off down the hangar and around the freighters.  Supriya was climbing down the ladder someone had put up against the Z-95.  BD-B2 scurried towards him, hooting and whistling.  Imzi wasn’t far behind with a pair of blasters in her hands.
 	
<p>“I saw some commotion on the main deck above,” Andrew said to her.  “Any idea what’s going on?”
 	
<p>“We’ve been listening to the Imperial comms while you’ve been gone,” Imzi said. “It looks like others are fighting back and slowly re-taking the ship.”
 	
<p>Supriya held her arm out, taking one of the blasters from Imzi. 
 	
<p>“Well then,” she said, looking at Andrew and cocking the blaster, “up for another round of fun?”
 	
<p>“The more, the merrier,” he said, taking the other blaster.  BD-B2 began hopping up and down. “Yes, Bee-Dee,” Andrew said, “you can come too.”  
 	
<p>Without wasting any more time, the trio made their way towards the lift.  As the gate behind them shut, Supriya hit the button to activate the lift and they began their upwards ascent.
