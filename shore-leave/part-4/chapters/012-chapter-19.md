Chapter 19
:::
 	
The door to the SSD Lounge whisked open as Andrew walked into it.  The familiar hum and buzz of patrons talking, laughing, or playing a variety of games filled the air.
 	
“There’s the man of the hour!” called Reynolds from across the room.  Andrew saw him at one of a trio of tables filled with pilots from Rogue, Buccaneer, Corsair, and Spectre Squadrons. “Three cheers for the Hero of Eudora!”
 	
A series of cheers arose from the pilots at the three tables.  Andrew also noticed that Captain Supriya had joined them as well as he grabbed an empty chair and sat down.
 	
“Please,” he said over the cheers, “alright, that’s enough.  It was nothing.”
 	
“Exposing and foiling an Imperial operation is no small matter,” said Syntax.
 	
“Which,” Andrew continued, “I would not have been able to do without some of you.  Or Captain Supriya.”
 	
“Hear hear!” said someone.
 	
“So, Captain,” Andrew asked as Iggy walked over with a fresh round of drinks, “to what do we owe the pleasure of your company?”
 	
Supriya reached for one of the mugs on the tray and took a drink from it.
 	
“I had to meet with Major Murg before he headed down to a meeting on Eudora,” she said, placing the mug on the tabletop.  “And, since I have some time to kill before my shuttle leaves, I thought it would be a good idea to get to know some of the members of the Renegade Wing.”
 	
“So tell us, Major,” asked Gremlin, finishing a sip from her drink, “how was your snuggle time?  I mean,” she quickly corrected herself with a quick giggle, “downtime?”
 	
Andrew shot her a look of disapproval.  She, in turn, gave him a wink and a wicked grin.
 	
“Come now,” said Reynolds, picking his mug up again. “I’m sure the Major enjoyed his downtime.” 
 	
Before he could say anything more, Reynolds stood up, cleared his throat, and raised his mug. 
 	
“A toast,” he said, “to Major Dobson.”  
 	
Captain Supriya pulled a small harmonica tuner from her pocket and blew into it, providing a musical key that was all too familiar.
 	
“For he is the Vice-Admiral’s Major General,” Reynolds began to sing.
 	
“Yes, he is the Vice-Admiral’s Major General,” followed everyone else at the table.
 	
Andrew looked around, bewildered.
 	
“How did you?...” he began.
 	
Gremlin leaned closer, mug in hand. “The show was broadcasted across the local Holo Net channel.  I just so happened to record it.”
 	
Andrew stared at her in disbelief, then at everyone else.  They were eagerly waiting for him to continue the song.  Supriya grinned and gave him an encouraging nod.  Grabbing a mug from the tray, he held it aloft with Reynolds and the others.
 	
“Yes, it is, it is a glorious thing I’m the Vice-Admiral’s Major General,” he continued to a round of cheers.  
 	
As the pilots of Renegade Wing and Captain Supriya continued on with the song, Andrew let go for once and enjoyed the moment for what it was.  
 	
He was home.  And there was no one else, except for Dia, who he’d rather be with.

The door whisked open to the viewing room of the local security force.  Mogazz Murg entered the dimly lit room, making his way to one of the two empty chairs that sat facing the one-way glass.  In the room on the other side of the glass sat Korwin Solari in an orange correctional jumpsuit, being grilled by two officers of the local security force.  A lawyer sat next to Solari.
 	
“Suli,” said Murg as he sat down in the chair. “Good to see you again.”
 	
“Hello, Mogazz,” Suli said, glancing at him. “It’s been some time since I’ve seen you last.”
 	
“Perhaps a bit too long,” he said. “Though I’m sure you appreciate the tireless work of the New Republic Intelligence Department.”
	
“That I do,” she said. “I’m sure you understand the many contributions I’ve made to the Rebel Alliance, and now the New Republic, over the years?”
 	
“All of which we are very thankful for,” he said, bowing his head in acknowledgement. “It’s very fortunate that someone like Korwin Solari was apprehended.  He can provide us some vital information regarding his dealings with Captain Gaspra, and ultimately Tol Barand.”
 	
Suli shifted in her seat. 
 	
“I hope so, Major,” she said. “Threats of orbital bombardment are very serious.  Even more serious is the amount of material that Solari was able to give them in the time period they were working together.”  She turned to look at him in his seat. “I fear that something big is on the horizon.”
 	
“As do I,” said Murg, lifting up the data pad he held in his hand. “How is Solari, anyway?”
 	
“He’ll eventually get over that broken nose I gave him,” she said, a small smile spreading across his face.”  Murg glanced to see a small bandage covering the bridge of Solari’s nose. “But he’s been surprisingly forthcoming about the entire debacle.”
 	
Murg nodded his head a few times, clearly pleased at this information.
 	
“What you should understand, Major,” Suli continued, “is that men like Solari are capable of many things.  His is a history of success at all costs, and he is now paying the price for that whether he likes it or not.  The irony of all this is that one of the motivating factors for him that was not explained earlier was that the Empire told him they had information on the accident that destroyed his family, specifically his sister.  Something about rectifying a mistake.”
 	
Murg held up the data pad in his hands. 
 	
“I believe I can provide an answer for that,” he said.  Suli gave him an intrigued look.  “As you know, a number of years ago the Solari family’s personal ship was attacked.  The official story was that marauders disabled, boarded the family transport, and killed all aboard.  In reality, it was the Empire that killed his parents and kidnapped his sister.”
 	
“Really?” Suli asked. “To what end?”
 	
“We’re not entirely sure,” Murg said, “but what we do know is that two years after the fact, his sister was rescued during a raid by Saw Guerrera’s forces on an Imperial plantation.  Due to Saw’s … unique position within the Rebel Alliance at the time, not to mention being pursued by the Empire, he was unable to return her to Eudora.  She essentially spent the next number of years serving under Saw’s forces, including when he split from the Rebel Alliance and became a radical.”
 	
“You’re kidding?” Suli asked.
 	
“I wish I were,” Murg said.
 	
“But weren’t Saw and his forces destroyed on Jedha?” Suli asked.
 	
“Most of them, yes,” Murg nodded, “but a number of individuals who served with him at one point or another still exist.  I’m still pulling as many strings as I can with my connections, but I have reason to believe we may have found her in the Outer Rim region.  If it is her, every effort will need to be made to de-radicalize her if necessary.”
 	
Suli contemplated on the news that had been given to her.
 	
“Will you tell Solari that?” she asked.
 	
“In time,” Murg said as he stood up and made his way towards the door. “It would be best to extract as much information from Solari as we can before we can give him some peace of mind.  If peace of mind can be had.”
 	
Mogazz Murg pressed the button to open the door and entered the room.  As the door closed behind him, Murg took his seat in an empty chair.  Suli watched the rest play out with interest.

Epilogue
 	
Captain Gaspra looked at the cold, glaring eyes of Tol Barand through the holographic projector from her desk.  She had appraised him of the loss of their most recent venture.
 	
“I must say, Captain,” he said slowly, “I’m not pleased about the ending of our venture with Solari.  He could have proven to be a useful ally, in particular economically.”
 	
“I agree, Commodore,” Gaspra said carefully. “Though with so little of our resources used in this affair, I would say we still came out ahead.”
 	
“Perhaps,” Barand mused, “though not as much as I would have liked.  Especially,” he continued, his stare boring into her, “with the loss of a squadron of TIE Fighters and stormtroopers to members of Renegade Wing.  And a group of theatre actors,” he finished with venom in his voice.
 	
Gaspra maintained her composure, but could feel the sweat forming on her brow underneath the captain’s hat.
 	
“If I may offer one more suggestion, sir,” she said, her mouth feeling dry. “I may have an idea to strike back at Renegade Wing.”
 	
Barand raised an eyebrow in query. 
 	
“We’ve already crippled their forces,” he said. “For the time being we must turn our attention elsewhere.”
 	
“I agree, sir,” Gaspra said with a nod. “But given the casualties they sustained, I think it is time for something more … insidious.”
 	
“Go on,” Barand said after a moment.
 	
“I’ll still need to work out the details with you, sir,” she said. “But Baterron and Eudoran media have identified a handful of members of Renegade Wing or other factions that we may be able to do something about.  And, with the recent decline in Renegade Wing pilots, it could provide us an opportunity while they rebuild.”
 	
“An interesting proposal, Captain,” Barand said. “Develop your plan, then present it to me accordingly.”
 	
“Yes, Commodore,” she said.  His holographic image disappeared.  Pressing a button, the image of two figures appeared in front of her.  One was of a blue-skinned Twi’lek.  The other a human male.  The names ‘Dia Tann’ and ‘Andrew Dobson’ were underneath each image.  
 	
“Chief,” she said, pressing the comm button to the bridge on her desk. “Have our intelligence officer report to my ready room immediately.  We have some planning to do.”
