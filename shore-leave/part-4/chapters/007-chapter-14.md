Chapter 14
:::
 	
Her head throbbing, Suli slowly awoke.  She blinked a few times and tried to move her arms and tentacle appendages.  Her appendages were bound by pairs of heavy bindings of some sort.  Her arms were cuffed together.  She tried to move her legs, but found these bound.
 	
“Ah, good. You’re awake,” came Solari’s voice.
 	
“Solari,” she growled, looking towards his voice.  She found him sitting in a chair on the other side of the room.  He looked calm, though certainly on guard.  Miguel and four stormtroopers stood behind him. “What is the meaning of this?”
 	
Solari stood up and began walking towards her slowly, hands in his pockets.  
 	
“I’m terribly sorry for all of this, my dear,” he said.  “I never intended for you to get caught up in all of this.”
 	
She tried to prop herself up, but couldn’t.  
 	
“I should have known better,” she huffed as she tried to move. She shot him a piercing glance. “You always were a snake.”
 	
“On the contrary, my dear Suli.”  He bent down on one knee and took her gently by the shoulders, then moved her body so that she was sitting upright on the soft carpet. “You may see me as a snake, but I -- like my mother and father before me -- see myself as an opportunist.”
 	
She gathered what spit there was in her mouth and spit in his face.  Saliva dripped down his left cheek.  He sighed as he removed a handkerchief from one of his pockets and wiped the spit away.  Then he stood up and began slowly pacing in front of her.
 	
“I had tried to plan for your escape, you know,” he said. “Nor did Miguel play any part in my plans.  Unfortunately dear Miguel here and his … escort … arrived at the wrong moment.”
 	
She looked past Solari at Miguel, who had a grave, disheartened look on his face. Had she not been tied up, she could have slapped him for working with the Imperials.  Then again, his family being kidnapped had certainly given him no choice for his actions.
 	
“You don’t know how hard it was to make this decision, Suli,” said Solari. 
 	
“If you’re working with the Empire,” she said bitterly, “you’re a traitor.”
 	
“I am not a traitor!” he snapped, stopping where he was.  “I’m saving our people!”
 	
“How?” she asked. “How could a man like you possibly save us by working with the Empire?”
 	
“It’s either this,” said Solari, regaining his composure, “or invasion.”
 	
“Invasion?”
 	
“A few months ago,” Solari continued, “I was contacted by a Captain Gaspra.  She brought a message from a man by the name of Commodore Tol Barand.  As the leading economic employer and businessman in the region, I was given a choice.  Work with the Empire to give them supplies, or risk an orbital bombardment that would destroy all of our major capital cities and population centres within a twenty-four hour period.”
 	
“But Korwin,” she said, “you know that we have loose ties with the New Republic.  We have some security forces.  Their cruisers are currently docked here for repairs.”
 	
“I know,” he said, continuing to pace back and forth. “But it wouldn’t have been enough, Suli.  The _Vigilant_ sustained significant damage; the _Sovereignty_ is the only other major ship with them. And our security forces, while reliable, pale in comparison to a Star Destroyer with a full complement of TIE Fighters and supporting cruisers.”
 	
_Can’t argue with him about that point_ she thought to herself.
 	
“Surely you would know that the New Republic would send aid,” she said.
 	
“But not in time!” he said, pointing a finger at her. “And risk bringing the galactic civil war to our front doorsteps?  I think not.”  He stopped where he was moving to face her, then began gesticulating his hand in the air. “The New Republic is too spread out, fighting on too many fronts that Imperial forces hold -- and are still holding.  I will not risk an open war that will take millions of innocent lives and billions of credits from our economy.”
 	
She sighed and shook her head.
 	
“So you decided to make a deal with the devil, then?”
 	
“No! No. I made a choice based on the hand I was given.  I’m not proud of it, believe me.  But it is for the greater good.  And once something is started, a Solari always sees it through.  A Solari is always successful.”
 	
She watched as he made his way over to a small table and poured himself a drink. Suli knew that if she kept talking to him about the issue, they would end up arguing in circles.  It was then that a new thought popped into her mind.
 	
“The pirate raids … the citizens and visitors being kidnapped … did you also make them a part of this?” 
 	
Solari froze, mid-drink.  He lowered the glass from his mouth slightly.
 	
“Not initially,” he said after a moment.
 	
“Oh, Korwin,” she said disheartened. “What have you done?”

“What I had to,” he said, taking another drink.  “One of the stipulations of the agreement to not have an orbital bombardment was to increase production from our mining operations.  It wasn’t my idea, truthfully.  But Gaspa said they needed resources, and increased production timetables -- without raising too much suspicion from my competitors.  It was she that enlisted the help of local pirate gangs.”
 	
“And yet you knowingly employed them against their will.”
 	
“Yes,” he said bitterly, draining the drink from his glass. “I’m not proud of it.  But yes.”
 	
She stared at him, letting the tension between them rise.
 	
“You’re pathetic,” she said, finally.  Solari’s gave her a sour look.
 	
“At least your husband’s safe and being taken care of.  Without me, he wouldn’t have lasted as long as he has,” he said after a moment.
 	
Something in her snapped with this new piece of information.  With all her strength, she used her appendages to try and pry the bindings apart.  The first pair wouldn’t budge, but the second began to slowly come apart.  She managed to slide out one of her left tentacle appendages, and sent it flying towards Solari.  It grabbed him by the throat, lifting him off the ground.
 	
“You monster!” she spat. “How could you?!”
 	
“She’s breaking free!” called one trooper.
 	
Two troopers rushed forward, blasters read.  Solari hung in the air, both hands clawing at the tentacle around his neck, gasping for breath.  Each fired a stun shot at her.
 	
Her body went limp.  Solari fell to the floor, the tentacle loosening from around his neck.  One of the troopers made to help him, but he was waved off.
 	
“I’m fine,” Solari choked out. “I’m fine.”  He picked up the glass that he had dropped on the floor and moved to place it back on the table, rubbing his neck as he did.  He stared at her lifeless form, wishing that everything could be different.  Could be better.  “Make sure that she is rebound,” he said to one of the troopers. “Securely this time.”
 	
As the troopers began to work on Suli, one of the ones near Miguel tapped at his helmet.
 	
“Understood,” he said, stepping forward. “Mister Solari, the transports will be here shortly.  We need to go.  Shall we bring her?”
 	
“We will,” he said after a moment. “She knows too much.”

Standing just out of sight behind the corner of one of the connecting hallways, Andrew quickly peeked around the corner.  There was a large booth that was made of half-glass, half metal. None of the ship’s security members were present.  The four Imperial stormtroopers in the room, however, presented an entirely different problem.
 	
“How many?” she whispered as he concealed himself once more.
 	
“Four,” he said quietly. “Though with that many on the security systems, it’s a miracle we made it this far.”
 	
“It’s a big ship,” she said.  “They’re probably still figuring out the security system and floor plans.”
 	
“I don’t think we’ll--”
 	
They both heard footsteps coming down the hall.  Supriya raised a finger to her lips, indicating silence.  Andrew held his breath, readying his blaster.  Two voices began speaking, then trailed off as the troopers began to move down the hall again. When he could not hear the troopers anymore, he let out a breath.
 	
“That was close,” he said under his breath. “What’s the plan?”
 	
He saw her think for a moment, trying to devise a plan. 
 	
“Best thing to do is draw some of them out,” she said. “Like an ambush.  I can lead at least two out and then--”
	
“Hey!” said the voice of a white-clad stormtrooper as he rounded the corner. “You’re not supposed to be--”.
 	
Supriya slid past Andrew with lightning-like reflexes and put the trooper in a choke hold.
 	
“Not a word,” she said gruffly into his helmet, “or I blow your brains out.”  The trooper didn’t move or say a word.  Supriya motioned with her head for Andrew to follow.  “Now, you’re going to move.  Slowly.  And take me and my friend to the security room.”
 	
The trooper gave a slight nod and began to walk forward.
 	
_Well, there goes the element of surprise,_ thought Andrew as he fell in behind her.
 	
As they passed through the doorway, he could just make out the other troopers monitoring the security system and giving instructions.
 	
“Nobody move,” she barked as she and the stormtrooper stopped a few steps in the doorway.  She pressed the blaster to his helmet, this time firmly. “Move and he gets his brains blown out.”
 	
The other three stormtroopers froze where they were.  Andrew tracked one that had made to go for his blaster and pointed the blaster he held at the trooper before he could reach it.
 	
“Blasters on the floor, hands in the air” she barked.  “Now!” 
 	
The three troopers complied, placing their E-11s on the ground, then raised their hands behind their heads.
 	
Andrew saw Supriya’s glance and slight nod out of the corner of his eye.  As she pushed the trooper she held away from her, he began firing stun shots at the two nearest troopers to him.  She, in turn, shot the third trooper and the one that she pushed away.  All four fell to the ground with a muffled yell and a thud.
 	
“That was easy enough,” she said, throwing him a wink.  He stood there, his mouth agape.
 	
“How did you know that would work?” he asked her as they collected the blasters and sat down at the main security console.
 	
“I didn’t,” she said. “But they didn’t know that we had our weapons set for stun, did they?”
 	
“Touche,” he said, beginning to cycle through the cameras. “Looks like they’re holding the bulk of the passengers in the dining halls,” he said.  “Others look trapped in other spacious areas.  Then there’s the people on the bow, and--”
 	
As the screen switched to a new vantage point, he saw Dia exit a service elevator, blaster in hand.
 	
“Oh no,” he said.
 	
“What is it?” Supriya asked him.  He gave her a quick glance.
 	

“It’s my partner.  Looks like she’s trying to make her way to somewhere.”  He switched the screen again, which showed a hallway from another angle.  Dia began to make her way down it.  A sign near her read _Deck 8_. She began pressing buttons on one of the nearby doors.  It wouldn’t open. Suddenly, a blaster bolt exploded against the wall near her head.  She spun around and fired several shots at her off-screen opponent, then began running down the hall.  He tried to find her again, but the screens began shifting to other cameras on other decks.
 	
“Dammit!” he cursed.
 	
“I’m sure she can handle herself,” Supriya said, gently placing a firm hand on his shoulder.  “Now, let’s see if we can pull up other major areas.”
 	
He continued cycling through the camera feeds until he found the bridge.  It was empty, but sparks rained down from some of the main consoles while smoke continued to fill the room.
 	
“Looks like the bridge has been sabotaged,” she said.  No way we can get a message out if that’s the case.”
 	
He pressed the security feed buttons a few more times.  The hangar bay with the racers came up.  He saw the racers sitting on the floor with a handful of stormtroopers guarding them or patrolling the hangar bay.  Three small freighters which he didn’t recognize also occupied the hangar bay.
 	
“That must explain how they got on board,” she said, pointing at the screen. “Arrive concealed in shipping freighters presumably carrying supplies.  Docking ramps open, and Imperial troops descend instead.”
 	
“Catching everyone by surprise,” he finished. “I don’t like our chances of taking that hangar bay alone.
 	
“Neither do I,” she said, “but we have no choice.  But if we’re careful, we might manage it.”
 	
“Doesn’t seem like we have much of a choice,” he said with a disheartened sigh.  One of the other screens in the room, he had noticed, had changed to show a squad of four troopers making their way down a hall they had used to get here earlier.  “Looks like more trouble on the way, and no time to change into their armor.”  He looked back at Supriya earnestly. “Only way we’ll be able to get a message out is to use the racers.  They have long-range radios.  Imperials are probably jamming radio frequencies from the ship, too, so we’ll have to get airborne.” 
 	
“Then it’s a good thing I know how to fly,” she said.
 	
He glanced up at her with a raised eyebrow.
 	
“What?” she asked, putting a hand on her hip and gesticulating with the other. “I had to start my career somewhere.”
 	
He turned his chair to look around the room, finding a deck schematic on the opposite wall.
 	
“We’re here,” he said, standing up and pointing a finger at the red dot.  “Hangar is another twelve decks down by the looks of it.”  He began tracing the staircase and lift locations.  
 	
“Any one of these points once we get to deck nine will take us there,” she said.  “If we’re careful, we can make it.”
 	
The stormtroopers behind them began to stir, moaning in pain.  Supriya shot all four of them with bulls-eye accuracy.  They crumpled to the floor again with groans.
 	
“What?” she asked Andrew as he gave her another puzzled look. “I like to spend time on the blaster range, too.”
 	
“Remind me to never get on your bad side,” he said.  He moved to the doorway again and checked the hallway.  It was clear.  “Come on, let’s go.”

:::


 	
Dia sprinted down the hallway as best she could, twisting to fire shots back at the stormtrooper pursuing her.
 	
“Just my mother-kriffing luck,” she panted to herself, “taking a wrong turn and running into this mud-skupper.”  Two blaster bolts zipped past her head, causing her to duck in reaction.  She pivoted and dropped to her knee, raised her blaster, and fired.  A stun run ripped forward and caught the trooper in mid-run, causing him to crumple loudly onto the floor.  “There,” she said with a laugh. “Solved that problem.”
 	
She got up and tried to get her bearings, doubling back to take the trooper’s blaster.  Unfortunately, in the chase with the trooper she had gotten turned around and didn’t know exactly where she was.
 	
“Sithspit,” she cursed, not seeing a sign.  “Guess I’ll have to use a woman's intuition for this one.” 
 	
She made her way down the hallway where it connected into a four-way corridor.  As she rounded the right corner, quickly checking her left to see if anyone was coming, she crashed into someone coming the other way.  Both let out a yell of surprise and pain.  Without thinking, Dia lifted one of the blasters.
 	
“Don’t shoot!” came the familiar voice.  “Don’t shoot!”
 	
Dia refocused her attention on the person in front of her.  It was Seela.
	
“Seela!” she said. 
 	
“Oh my goodness,” Seela said, tears forming in her eyes. “I’m so glad I found you!”  She hugged Dia in thanks. “There’s stormtroopers and pirates everywhere.  It’s horrible!”
 	
“Okay, easy now,” said Dia, gently pushing her back.  Seela began to wipe away the tears on her face. “Come on, we can’t linger here.”
 	
As they briskly made their way down the corridors, taking turns when it was safe, Seela recounted to Dia how Solari had been behind the whole operation. How she was being escorted away by Imperial troopers after she woke up, only to be ambushed by some security guards who were trying to take back sections of the ship unsuccessfully.  She’d had other close encounters until she met Dia.
 	
“I’m glad you’re safe,” Dia said as they came to another set of corridors.  “Where are we anyway?”
 	
Seela gave a sniff and rubbed her nose. “Deck four, near the entertainment section I think.”
 	
“Sithspit,” said Dia, “I’m not even close to where I want to be.”  A sound came from the other end of the hall.  Then another.  As a door flew open, Dia dragged Seela around the corner so that they could hide.  Heavy footsteps came down the hall.
 	
“I don’t see why the captain wants us to scour the entire ship,” came one voice. “Shoulda left that job for the Imperials.”
 	
“Cap’n wants us to round up any stragglers.  The more we round up, the more the Empire pays us,” said the second voice.
 	
The bootsteps grew louder against the steel plating of the floor.  Dia held her breath, and Seela did her best to not let a whimper escape her lips.  As the two men came around the corner, she saw that one was a Quarren while the other was Gotal. Luckily, they had their backs to the two women.
 	
“Another junction,” said the Gotal.  “Which way should we go?”
 	
Dia raised the blaster in her right hand and pointed it at the two men.
 	
“Right here is just fine,” she said with a smirk.  The two men whirled around, surprised to find the two women there.  Each received a stun blast from Dia that dropped them like stones, all while Seela gave a cry of surprise.
 	
“Here,” said Dia as she moved to stand over the two men. “They won’t be out long. Take their blasters.”
 	
Seela stared for a second at the men before removing their blasters from their hands. Dia, meanwhile, took note of the signs that were posted on the corridor walls.  She was happy that she had options as well as directions.
 	
“This way,” she said, pointing down the hallway.  They made their way down it, then turned right.
 	
“Where are we going?” Seela asked.

“To get you somewhere safe.  Here,” she said, pointing to a pair of doors that read _Lounge_.  Pressing the button on the panel, the door whisked open. 
 	
She took maybe two steps inside before seeing a pair of stormtroopers guarding a group of people.
 	
Seela gave a cry of surprise, as did some of the people.
 	
Someone yelled “Watch out!”
 	
The troopers spun around and raised their blasters.
 	
But Dia was quicker.
 	
The troopers dropped to the floor.  Gasps arose from the small group of people.
 	
“Good heavens,” said a gentleman in a long and richly decorated flowing overcoat. “You saved us!”  The rest of the individuals behind him began to stand up.
 	
“Is everyone all right?” Dia asked, now realizing that everyone in the group was dressed rather unusually for a cruise.  It then dawned on her that they were wearing costumes, and that these must be actors for the play.
 	
“We are now,” piped up the Rodian standing next to the first man who spoke, “thanks to you.”
 	
“Who are you?  Why did they put you here?” Dia asked.  The lead gentleman stepped forward, removed his wide-brimmed fedora with its feather, and gave a sweeping bow.
 	
“I am Reginald Thirdbottom the Fourth, my good lady,” he said, standing back up. “And the good men and women you see with me are members of The Royal Duchesses’ Acting Troupe.  Say hello, troupe.”
 	
Those standing behind Reginald Thirdbottom gave gentle waves and a unified “hello!”
 	
Dia would have rolled her eyes if it wasn’t impolite.  
 	
_Just my luck_ she thought. 

_Actors._

“To answer your other inquiry,” Reginald went on, “we were escorted here by the stormtroopers you so timely disabled.  It would appear from overhearing their conversation that we are being separated into groups to be transported away.”
 	
Dia raised an eyebrow, curious at this last statement.
 	
“Did they happen to say where or why?” she asked.
 	
“Sadly, they did not, m’lady,” replied Reginald.
 	
“It could be part of the pirate attacks,” said Seela as she stepped next to Dia.  She then explained briefly the rash of abductions over the last number of weeks and months.
 	
“That explains a lot,” Dia said, then turned to face Reginald. “Look, I can’t stay here long. I need to find a way to get to a place that can broadcast, or at least help control the ship.  You can either join me, or stay here and lock the doors and tie up these two,” she said, pointing at the stormtroopers.
 	
The actors began looking at one another nervously, some wringing their hands or fiddling with their costumes.
 	
“There might be a slight problem with that, m’lady,” said Reginald.  “You see … we’re trained as actors.  Not fighters.”  The others nodded in agreement.
 	
“And I respect that,” said Dia. “But if what Seela says is true, people’s lives are at stake.  Any troopers or pirates on board aren’t firing to kill; they are firing to stun.  If I can contact one of the New Republic ships in orbit, I can radio for help.  But I may not be able to do that by myself against a ship full of enemies.”
 	
Reginald knuckled his moustache and thought for a moment, then let out a sigh.
 	
“If you will give us a moment to confer with one another, m’lady.  Perhaps while you take care of the two white-clad gentlemen yonder?” he said, pointing at the unconscious troopers.  As Dia began to cuff the troopers and remove their essential gear and communication devices, Reginald called for the actors to huddle.  They spoke in low voices.
 	
As she propped the second unmasked trooper up against the wall, the troupe of actors broke from their huddle.
 	
“We have held a quorum on the matter,” he said.  “While some would prefer to remain within the safety of this room, there are several of us -- myself included -- who wish to help.”  Several of the troupe members nodded their heads in agreement.
 	
“Excellent,” said Dia.  The blasters were divided amongst the members who felt comfortable handling them, while one was left with Seela.  “As soon as we leave that door,” Dia said to her, “lock it.  Don’t let anyone in until it is safe.  And keep your eye on these two,” she said to the remaining members of the troupe while motioning to the two stormtroopers.  
 	
Reginald and his group gathered around Dia, blasters -- and surprisingly enough, stage props such as swords and clubs -- in hand.
 	
“M’lady,” said Reginald resolutely. “We are yours to command.”
 	
“Okay,” said Dia with a partial laugh. “The first thing you're going to do is stop calling me ‘M’lady’.  Secondly … could you drop the eccentric act and talk normally?”
 	
Reginald exchanged a glance with the members behind him, then with Dia. 
 	
“Of course, Lady Dia,” he said. Dia rolled her eyes when he said this. “And, it is important for me as an actor to maintain my character.  Also,” he said after a moment, “I’m rather terrified and being in character helps me cope with this situation.”
 	
Dia gave a mild scoff as she turned around and exited the door. “Actors,” she muttered.
