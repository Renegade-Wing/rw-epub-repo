Chapter 18
:::
 	
Andrew awoke groggily in a bed.  He wasn’t sure how long he’d been out, but his throat still hurt and his arm stung.  He looked to see his bandaged shoulder, and also took note that he was in someone’s private quarters.
	
“Ah, good. You’re awake,” came Suli’s voice.  Supriya was standing with her arm also bandaged next to Suli.  “And in good timing, too.  How do you feel?”
 	
“Like I got hit with a train,” he said hoarsely, rubbing the back of his head. “What happened to Solari?”
 	
“He’s being taken care of,” cut in Supriya, “and is currently being held for questioning in the ship’s brig -- along with the Imperials and pirates that the New Republic has yet to transport off the ship.”
 	
He gave a weak smile. “That’s good,” he said, leaning back into the soft pillow.
 	
“Captain Supriya here tells me that it was you two who were flying those Z-95s earlier,” Suli said, “and that it was your idea to get word to the ships in orbit.”
 	
“It was,” he said after a moment.
 	
“You do realize that you damaged part of my ship in the process,” she said, raising an eyebrow.
 	
“Yeah,” said Andrew nervously. “Sorry about that.”
 	
The Contessa looked at him intently, a wry smile spreading across her face. 
 	
“You’ve caused quite a bit of trouble here, Major,” she said. “But I know just what you need.”
  	
He felt himself being lifted simultaneously by her pair of hands and the tentacled appendages protruding from her back.  As the appendages curled around his body, he felt them change from a firm grasp to one where he was being squeezed to the point of not being able to breathe.  Where her appendages touched his skin, he could feel the softy, velvety suckers grasping his skin.  Sitting upright, staring her in the eyes, uncertain of what she was about to do next, it almost felt as if he was having the breath squeezed out of him.
 	
“This,” he half-gasped, “isn’t really necessary.”
 	
The Contessa’s eyes glinted, like a creature about to make the final move against its prey.  She gave a low, throaty laugh of amusement. 
	
“Oh, but it is, Major,” she said, constricting her grip a bit more.
 	
He tried to take a gasp of air, but had difficulty doing so.
 	
“Now,” she said, gently pursing her lips, “it’s time to get the reward you deserve.”  She drew him close to her, her eyes closing, her ruby-red lips pursed to give him a kiss.
 	
It was at that moment that the door to the room slid open.
 	
“AUNTIE SULI!” shouted a voice. “Put him down this instant!”  
 	
Everyone in the room turned to look at a perturbed Dia standing just inside the doorway, a gentleman with a feathered fedora and elaborately constructed overcoat behind her.
 	
“Dia?” Suli asked, looking at her. “You’re here?!”
 	
“She’s your aunt?” Andrew croaked out in surprise.
 	
“The man you hold is my partner.  Release him.”
 	
“Very well,” Suli said with a sigh, exchanging glances with her and Andrew. “Though I don’t see why a simple kiss as a reward for heroics should be an issue.”
 	
Dia crossed the room to meet Andrew as Suli set him down on his feet.
 	
“You have uncle for that,” Dia said, looking at Suli intently.  She turned to look at Andrew, noticing the gauze padding taped to his shoulder. “What happened to you?” she asked incredulously.
 	
“I, uh,” Andrew began, “may have taken a blaster shot to the arm while saving your aunt,” he said.
 	
A blue palm raced towards his face and slapped his cheek.
 	
“Ow!” he exclaimed in surprise. “What was that for?!”
 	
“That’s for getting yourself shot, you nerf herder,” Dia said crossly. “And this,” she said, grabbing onto his shirt collar and pulling him towards her, their lips locking together. “This is for calling for help when we needed it.”
 	
Supriya stifled a laugh by placing a palm up to her face.  The man in the fedora raised an eyebrow.
 	
“I am so confused,” Andrew said as Dia hugged him, wincing as the sting in his shoulder.

The rest of the evening went by in a blur.  The commandos from the Vigilant were operating security and relief efforts as shuttles from New Republic and the local resort were ferrying crew to the mainland.  While the ship had been retaken, a number of passengers were critically wounded or killed in the firefight.  Most people were shocked and scared, and simply wanted off the boat.  It would take some time to use tractor beams to tow it back to harbor, but that could wait.  Rogue and Corsair Squadrons maintained a general patrol in the area just in case, and had handily dispatched of the TIE Fighters, not to mention forced some of the freighters to surrender to the New Republic forces -- though it was noted that Gaspra had managed to escape before the Rogues could catch up with her.
 	
Aboard the small ferry shuttle, Andrew and Dia sat in a corner at the back, she leaning against him.  They had given a quick debrief with the commanding New Republic officer before being loaded onto the transport with Reginald and the others.  Sitting at the back afforded them some privacy.  BD-B2 stood propped up against the back of one of the seats, looking out the window at the moving transports and glittering lights.
 	
They said nothing for most of the journey, letting the hum of the engines fill the air around them.  It was Andrew who decided to speak up first.
 	
“Some vacation, huh?” he asked, looking down at her.  She, in turn, looked up at him.
 	
“It would have been nicer had the Empire not gotten involved,” she said. “But most of it was pretty good.”
 	
“I’ve been doing some thinking,” he said a few moments later. “About your reaction earlier.”  She pulled away and sat up, meeting his face.
 	
“Our job is full of dangers,” he said. “And today is evidence of that.  If you don’t want me to put an application in for Rogue Squadron, I won’t.”
 	
She shook her head. “No,” she said, taking hold of his hand. “If you are intent on applying, you should apply.”
 	
“It’s dangerous,” he said.
 	
“It is,” she replied.
 	
“I could get shot down or captured,” he said.
 	
“It’s possible,” she replied.
 	
“I could even be killed.”
 	
“That’s supposed to be my job, not the Empire’s, you nerf herder,” she said.
 	
He gave a slight laugh. “So.  You’re really okay with it?” he asked.
 	
“If this is something you want to do, then you should do it,” she said. “But just understand that if you do apply, I’m applying too.”
 	
“What?” he asked. “Why?”
 	
“Someone has to watch your handsome butt when you’re flying amongst the stars.  And it might as well be me.”
 	
“Well now,” he said with a sigh, “I guess it’s settled then.”
 	
“It is,” she said, squeezing his hand.
 	
By the time they arrived back at their lodging in the resort hand in hand, it was nearly midnight.  Opening the door, Dia activated the lights while BD-B2 scurried off upstairs.  The day’s events weighed heavily on them, and they trudged up the winding staircase.  He was about to wish her goodnight when they reached the top of the landing when she gave a gentle tug and led him towards her room.
 	
“Where are we going?” he asked.
 	
As they reached the doorway to her room, he saw BD-B2 standing in the middle of the floor.
 	
“You,” said Dia, thumbing at BD-B2 towards the door. “Out.”
 	
The droid gave her a quizzical look and scurried out of the room without further protest.  Andrew watched him go.
 	
“I know it’s late,” she said, placing a palm on his cheek. “But I’m not ready to let you go just yet.”
 	
“You’re sure?” he asked her.  
 	
She nodded in reply.  
 	
“Okay then,” he said as she let go of his hand.  She moved to close the door, and locked it behind them before reaching up with her hands and pulling his mouth to hers.

The next day was a flurry of debriefings with the _Vigilant_ staff.  Captain Quelle had been impressed with their efforts, and granted them a few extra days of vacation while the entire ordeal -- including the operation Solari was embroiled in on Baterron.  They even made the news as clips from the ship and their valiant efforts were recorded or described by others.  The play, meanwhile, had been rescheduled to resume later this evening in outdoor amphitheatre.
 	
Supper was spent with Suli, as expected, who had been in a flurry of meetings with New Republic officials, as well as business representatives from her partners as well as Solari Enterprises.  Supriya and Reginald had also been invited to join them.
 	
“It would seem Solari Enterprises has taken quite a hit from this scandal,” Suli told them as their meal plates were taken away by the waiting staff.  “The board of directors has reached out to several individuals, myself included, to take Solari’s place.” 	
 	
“Do you think you’ll take the position, Auntie?” Dia asked.
 	
“I might,” Suli said, swirling the liquid in her glass. “Though it would create problems in that I’d effectively be running two major businesses, thus potentially creating a monopoly.  The trade board and local governments would never allow that.”
 	
“What about uncle?” Dia asked. “Surely when he recovers, he could be a strong candidate for the position.  Or even run your business ventures in your absence.”
 	
Suli raised an eyebrow as the dessert was delivered.
 	
“This, my niece, is why I love your perspicacity,” Suli said.
 	
Dia shrugged. “I learned it from you, after all.”
 	
Reginald, meanwhile, gave a sigh as he sat slouched in his chair, a knuckled fist pressed against his cheek.
 	
“What’s wrong, Reginald?” Supriya asked as she cut a fork through her chocolate dessert.
 	
“Oh, it’s the play,” he said. “The gentleman we had to play the role of the Vice-Admiral’s Major General was diagnosed with a concussion earlier.  There’s no way we’ll be able to have the show this evening and find someone on such short notice who knows the part.”
 	
Supriya and Dia looked at Reginald, then to Andrew.  Andrew stopped to look at them, a fork full of dessert lifted half-way to his mouth.
 	
“What?” he asked, looking at them.
 	
“You know the songs,” said Supriya.
 	
“And you’ve told me how much you enjoy Gilbert and Mulligan musicals,” said Dia.
 	
“Well now, Reginald,” said Suli, raising an eyebrow. “It seems as though the show shall go on after all.”
 	
“It will?” Andrew asked.

That night, Dia, Suli, Seela, and Supriya sat in the private tent that had been erected off to the side of the amphitheatre stage, giving them an excellent view of the stage and the action despite the terrain.  The area was overflowing with guests and theatre goers who wanted to see -- and in some cases, finish -- the play from the cruise ship.  The first half had been better than Dia expected, and she was beginning to enjoy the musical -- especially Reginald’s scenes -- by the time the intermission happened.
 	
“When does he come on?” she asked Supriya.
 	
“Soon,” she said with an amused smile, “and I think you’ll quite enjoy it.”
 	
It wasn’t long after the third act had begun that the next musical number started.  Reginald was on stage, in character, and trying to protect several of the pirates that were attempting to capture the female characters and hold them ransom for credits.
 	
“Hold, brigands!” sang Strong-arm Sally, “Before your troupe proceeds to capture us all, bear in mind that our father is the Vice-Admiral’s Major General!”
 	
Holden’s character, one of the pirate lieutenants, scurried up to the pirate leader.
 	
“Danger may befall, we’d better stall, their father is the Vice-Admiral’s Major General!” he sang.
 	
“Yes, yes, he’s the Vice-Admiral’s Major General,” sang the women in unison.
 	
The curtains opened and out strode Andrew, dressed in a khaki soldier’s uniform with a slough of medals attached to it, plus polished boots, and a fake beard and moustache.  He regally held a hot pink umbrella used to keep the sun’s rays out of one’s face.
 	
“Yes, yes, I am the Vice-Admiral’s Major General,” he sang as the actors made way for him as he walked upstage.
 	
Dia couldn’t contain her laughter and almost fell out of her seat.
 	
“For he is the Vice-Admiral’s Major General,” sang the cast, “Yes, he’s the Vice-Admiral’s Major General….”
 	
“And it is, it is a glorious thing to be the Vice-Admiral’s Major General,” continued Andrew as he moved about the stage.
 	
“This,” Dia said between laughs, wiping tears away from her eyes, “this is the best!”
 	
“Told you,” Supriya said, leaning over to her.
 	
Suli leaned over to whisper in Dia’s ear, and gently placed a hand on top of hers. 
 	
“You sure know how to pick them,” she said.  “He’s a keeper for sure.”
 	
“Yeah,” Dia said, shooting her aunt a smile. “He is.”

With the play over, the cast had begun to filter out onto the stage to take a final bow.  Waves of applause rose throughout the night air.  Suli made her way on stage from behind the curtains, with Dia and Supriya in tow.  Dia stopped next to Andrew, and whispered in his ear.
 	
“You are wonderfully talented and hilarious in that costume,” she said. “I think you’ll enjoy tonight even more.”
 	
Andrew’s face turned a shade of crimson as he began blushing.
 	
“Thank you,” Suli said into a microphone as the applause began to die down. “Thank you all for coming.  I hope,” she continued, pausing for a moment, “that you enjoyed tonight’s entertainment.  We have much to be thankful for after recent events, and much to think on for those who were lost at the hands of the Imperial and pirate forces.  I’d like to reassure you that the New Republic is working in tandem with our local security forces to ensure that an event like this does not happen again.”  A round of applause arose from the crowd.
 	
“The play you enjoyed this evening,” she said, looking around the amphitheatre and at the actors and actresses, “was a play of swashbuckling adventure and good fun.  The characters, both good and bad, mere fictitious creations of two very talented playwrights.  It was created for entertainment, and has been enjoyed by countless peoples throughout the decades.  But fiction and fact are two very different experiences.
 	
Many of you in attendance took part in the cruise events these last few days.  Tonight would not be possible without the action of a few key individuals who turned the tide, and allowed us to be here.  If I could have Major Dobson, Captains Tann and Supriya, and Reginald Thirdbottom the Fourth step forward please.”
 	
Murmurs rippled throughout the crowd as the four of them stepped forward near Suli.  
 	
“Three of the individuals before you were here, like many of you, to be entertained and enjoy some shore leave after their valiant struggle against the Galactic Empire. Yet, by their own volition, they employed their skills, ingenuity, and integrity to not only save my life, but yours as well.  I am also told,” Suli said, nodding to Reginald, “that Mister Thirdbottom was instrumental in rallying members of his acting troupe and passengers into a mobile force that overwhelmed their opponents.  It is my great honour to award each of them the Baterron Silver Star, the highest civilian award that Baterron and Eudora have to offer to individuals in times of great need and service to the public.”
 	
Seela appeared from behind the curtain carrying a small box that was open.  One by one she reached into the box and removed the star-shaped medal with its sea-themed designs and colors, pinning it to the coats or shirt of the individuals and then shaking their hands.  The crowd wasted no time in giving an extensive round of thunderous applause, whistles, and cheers to the four individuals.  In the front row, Andrew could see Ledwin and Imzi clapping enthusiastically.  As Ledwin gave a sustained whistle by placing two fingers in his mouth, Andrew nodded his thanks to each of them.  
 	
“How does it feel, Reginald,” Suli asked as she pinned the medal to his costume, “to be a hero?”
 	
“It was good while it lasted, m’lady,” he said above the applause, “but I think acting and playwriting will suit me just fine from now on.”
 	
“Indeed it shall,” she said, as she gave him a peck on his cheek.  Reginald blushed slightly as she pulled away. “Though I think you’ve earned the bow of your career.  The stage is yours, my noble sir.”
 	
As Suli stepped out of the way, the four took a step forward, waving to the crowd in thanks.  Reginald removed his feathered fedora, and took a sweeping bow, which earned him an extra round of applause and recognition from the audience.
 	
The night over, the crowd trickled away, and the heroes were left to their own volition.

“I do wish we had more time to spend together,” Suli said as she hugged Dia in front of the apartment, her small mountain of luggage behind her.  Bixby was working away, loading it into the back of the speeder that had been rented for them.
 	
“As do I, Auntie,” Dia said, hugging her back.  As the two broke their embrace, they smiled. “But duty calls once more.”
 	
They heard a rapping on one of the windows.  BD-B2 had removed the curtain and stood on the interior windowsill of a second-level window, indicating that he wanted out.
 	
“Almost forgot!” Dia said as she headed into the house to retrieve him.  Suli turned to look at Andrew.
 	
“I wish I could get to know you better, Major,” she said, cupping his hands in hers.  “You will always be welcome here, though I know duty calls for you as well.”  
 	
“It does, ma’am.  And if I may, I’d like to thank you for your hospitality.  It’s been an experience beyond my wildest dreams.”
 	
Suli caught a glance of Dia retrieving BD-B2 from the window.
 	
“My dear niece is clearly enamoured with you,” she said. “And as it would seem, you her.  Do be careful.  And watch after her for me.”
 	
“I will, ma’am,” he said.
 	
“And,” she said, letting go of his hands and raising an eyebrow in amusement, “if you two ever decide to get married -- and I strongly suggest you do -- do let me know.  Weddings are one of my many specialities.”
 	
Andrew gave a nervous laugh, and as the door to the apartment opened he was distracted just long enough that Suli reached behind him and gave his bottom a pinch, just like Dia would.  Andrew stifled a yelp of surprise despite jumping slightly, while Suli merely winked at him.
 	
“Do give uncle my best when you visit him in the hospital later,” Dia said as she held BD-B2 in her hands and gave Suli a kiss on her cheek.
 	
“I will, dear,” Suli said, kissing her back.  “You two take care!”
 	
Suli left and walked towards the speeder that Seela was driving, and waved as she drove past them.
 	
“Your aunt’s nice,” he said as the speeder turned the corner.
 	
“Nice is just the beginning,” Dia said as the two of them turned to finish loading the luggage.
 	
“How are you going to store all of this when you get back to wherever you’re stationed with General Syndulla?” he asked, place one of the luggage bags in the back of the speeder.
 	
“I’ll send most of it home to Ryloth,” she said.  “Auntie arranged for it to be sent via special transport.”
 	
“Figures,” he said with a wink.
 	
It didn’t take them long to finish packing the luggage.  Bixby drove them to the shuttle platform, where two shuttles were being prepped for take-off.  He gave an affirmative “Roger-roger” when told to take the luggage to Suli’s courier transport.
 	
“Guess this is it, huh?” Andrew asked, slinging his duffle bag over his shoulder and hitching a hand inside a pocket.
 	
“Yeah,” Dia said, a little disappointed. “For a little while, anyway.”
 	
“All the craziness aside,” he said, “this was a vacation to remember.  I can’t thank you enough for suggesting it.”
 	
“You’re welcome,” she said, slipping her arm around his waist as they began to walk towards the shuttles.  “So what are you going to do with the prize winnings?” she asked as they reached the last section before the ramps.
 	
“I’m sure I can think of a few things,” he said, looking down at her. “I did earn it after all.”
 	
“That you did,” she said with a small laugh.
 	
“Though I’m sure,” he finished with a wink, turning to face her, “I can think of a way to spend it on someone special.”
 	
They kissed one final time before parting ways, waving to each other as they boarded the shuttle ramps.  A knot filled in his heart, knowing that it would be some time before her would see her again, though he also knew it would not be the last.
