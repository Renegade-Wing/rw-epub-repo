Chapter 11
:::

<p>Suli deChenzzi stood alone at the railing of the upper level of the ship.  The stairway some meters behind her led back down to the upper level of the dining area.  Small lights lit the railing, providing a soft gentle glow as the sun had nearly set.  A cool breeze came off the water, causing her dress and appendages to move ever so slightly.  She was chilled, goosebumps appearing on her skin.  But her mind weighed heavily on other matters, especially her dance with Solari later that evening.  
 	
<p>She heard footsteps behind her as someone took the final steps from the staircase up onto the landing.  She glanced over her shoulder to see who it was.  It was Miguel.  She turned back to look at the sun as it disappeared completely behind the island, and heard him stop several feet away from her.
 	
<p>“Good evening, ma’am,” he said. “I hope I’m not disturbing you.”
 	
<p>“Not at all, Miguel,” she said, not turning around. “What do you have to report?”
 	
<p>“We’ve done a sweep of the security feeds, and questioned a number of possible witnesses that were in the general vicinity.  We do have one suspect -- a Mon Calamari --  in the detention area, but it’s difficult to know for certain if he was involved.”
 	
<p>“What do you mean?” she asked, turning around, brow furrowed.  
 	
<p>“No one specifically saw him release the droid, ma’am.  Too many people were focused on the race, and no security cams caught him deploying it.  Also … he’s currently drunk, ma’am.”
 	
<p>“Drunk?” she asked flatly.
 	
<p>“Yes.  He was rather inebriated when we found him.  We’ll have to wait until he’s sobered up to question him further.”
 	
<p>Suli gave a sigh of frustration. “Very well, Miguel.  In the meantime, have your people keep an eye out for anything suspicious.  I don’t want any more interruptions to our festivities.”
 	
<p>“Of course, ma’am.”  
 	
<p>With that, he turned to leave.  Before he got to the first step, she called him.
 	
<p>“Miguel,” she said.  He stopped, one foot on the step, and turned to face her. “How do I look?” she asked.
 	
<p>Miguel paused for a moment, considering his response. 
 	
<p>“If you don’t mind my saying so, ma’am -- and I hope I’m not being impolite -- you look very graceful for the ball this evening.”
 	
<p>A small smile formed across her mouth.
 	
<p>“Thank you, Chief,” she said.  “That will be all.”
 	
<p>With a polite nod, he left to attend to his duties.

<p>***

<p>Down in the ballroom, well over a hundred patrons milled about or sat at tables or other seating areas.  Waiters and waitresses carried trays of food full of appetizers and drinks around to the patrons while the main dining tables were being set up to receive the numerous foods that would be served throughout the evening.  More guests also milled about on the upper balcony above, with several pairs climbing the grand staircase.
 	
<p>Korwin Solari stood off to the side, speaking with several business and political individuals who were well-known to him.  Laughter trickled throughout the room as people told humorous jokes or anecdotes.  Solari took note of Chief Miguel as he descended the stairs and made his way towards the exit of the ballroom.  As the Chief looked around, his gaze met Solari’s.  Solari offered a polite nod and raised his glass.  The Chief, in turn, gave him a quick, unassuming nod before continuing on.
 	
<p>He briefly admired the crystal chandelier hanging from the ceiling before refocusing his attention on the discussion before him.
 	
<p>“So, Solari,” said one of the gentlemen across from him. “What’s your business secret?  Korwin Industries has earned a generous portfolio return of almost thirty-percent year over year for the last seven years running.”
 	
<p>“Well,” he said with a small smile, briefly looking at the floor. “A modest return such as that requires strategic positioning.  Especially to counter any economic headwinds.  Let’s just say that I prefer to keep the interests of Korwin Industries diversified.  Some might say that the fall of the Empire and the rise of the New Republic would be bad for business.  Tumultuous markets. Interrupted supply lines.  Currency devaluation. Contracts cancelled.”  His peers nodded in acknowledgement of the issues he listed.  They themselves had also needed to adjust to the new realities that the star system and the galaxy faced.  “In truth, I looked at the situation before me, and selected the best cards to play.  Nothing is better than free trade, and Korwin Industries trades freely -- for the right price, of course.”
 	
<p>A few laughs escaped the mouths of the patrons.
 	
<p>“Ladies and gentlemen,” came a voice over the PA system. The ship’s captain was holding a microphone in the centre of the room. The room fell silent as everyone turned their attention to him. “I’d like to thank you all for being here this evening.  The crew and I hope that you have been enjoying your time on the cruise so far, and look forward to providing you with an enjoyable series of events and festivities in the coming days.
 	
<p>This night would not be possible, however, without the generous support of two of Eudora’s most esteemed citizens and patrons.  I’d like to thank Mister Korwin Solari for his ongoing support of the Contessa’s Cup, as well as his generous donations this year to a number of charities involving victims of domestic violence, medical treatment centres, as well as youth programs in some of our other provinces.”
 	
<p>A wave of applause swept through the room.  Korwin stepped forward to address the crowd, raising his hand to thank the crowd. 
 	
<p>“Thank you,” he said as the applaus continued. “Thank you very much.”
 	
<p>As the clapping died down, the captain continued.
 	
<p>“Of course, this whole cruise would not be possible without the time, effort, and support of our hostess this evening.  Many of you know Miss Suli deChenzzi through her business and fundraising abilities, as well as her generous support of humanitarian and environmental causes, among her other philanthropic ventures.  Please allow me to welcome our hostess this evening, the inimitable Miss Suli deChenzzi!”
 	
<p>As the doors near the top of the staircase opened, Suli deChenzzi gracefully entered the room, followed by her assistant Seela.
	
<p>As she moved down the staircase in slow, fluid movements, anyone there would have commented on how beautiful she looked.
 	
<p>To Solari, she was the personification of beauty. 
 	
<p>She wore a stunning emerald green maxi wrap dress with a modestly plunging v-line, a slit exposing her leg at the thigh.  A gold necklace with a brilliant red ruby lay nestled between her throat and bosom, while gold-hooped earrings jangled as she made her way down each step.  Her assistant wore a more modest purple dress with a v-neck and slit that complemented her violet skin well.
 	
<p>Suli stopped half-way down the staircase, and raised her hand to the audience, smiling.
 	
<p>“Thank you!” she said as the applause died down. “Thank you all for coming!  And thank you, captain, for your kind words about my … and Mister Solari’s, endeavours,” she said, gesturing to Korwin.  “I look forward to an entertaining evening full of joy and laughter, good food and drinks, and of course speaking with many of you later.  To begin our evening,” she said, meeting Korwin’s gaze, “I think it appropriate to begin with a dance on our newly refurbished dance floor.
 	
<p>What many of you might not know,” Suli continued, “is that Mister Solari and I placed a little wager earlier this afternoon regarding the outcome of the Solari Star portion of the race.  Our wager was simple: if my pilot won, Mister Solari would donate fifteen-thousand credits to one of my charities.  If he won, he would have the pleasure of earning one dance with me.” A titter of excitement arose throughout the crowd, especially from the women.  “It would seem, however, that Mister Solari was the uncanny winner of this bet.  If our maestro wouldn’t mind getting us started…,” she said, motioning towards the band on the far side of the room.  She then turned to mouth something to Seela, who then began to make her way away from her mistress back up the stairs and around to one of the balcony ledges
 	
<p>Classical music began to fill the room as she descended the staircase.  Korwin excused himself, placing his empty champagne glass on an empty standing table tray to his left, then made his way towards Suli and the other patrons beginning to trickle onto the dance floor.
 	
<p>“I would have thought you would wait until later to dance,” said Korwin as he met Suli in the middle of the floor.
 	
<p>“One would think,” she said, extending her hand and speaking loudly enough so that only they could hear, “but I’d rather not risk losing my appetite.  I’m rather fond of the dessert menu this evening.”
 	
<p>His face not betraying the slight she had given him, he took her hand and the two began to move gracefully about the dance floor, each movement like fluid clockwork.  
 	
<p>“Come now, Suli,” he said playfully, flashing her his roguish smile. “Surely you don’t think that ill of me?”
 	
<p>“Right now, I do,” she said, meeting his eyes intently.  “While I can’t prove it, I still believe you had something to do with sabotaging that race earlier.”  She let him twirl her around, moving closer then away from him, just as the dance routine permitted.  Of course, she was careful to ensure that her appendages did not hit him.
 	
<p>“I assure you, my dear,” he said, “I was not involved with those events as you believe me to be.  You know anything I do is for the greater good. Solari’s honor.”
 	
<p>“Which,” Suli countered as they continued to sweep around the dance floor with the other patrons, performing a series of graceful dance moves, “is checkered at the best of times.  I remember some of the business dealings your mother and father made.  Yours are very similar, and you mince your words and business dealings like a snake when you see fit.  I wonder if your dear sister would agree with your methods?”
 	
<p>That last comment was like an icy knife plunging through his heart.  A rare, momentary flash of hurt spread across his face.
 	
<p>“You dare insult my family,” he hissed at her. “My dear, late sister?”  He made the decision to bury his feelings immediately, lest anyone else see them, and recomposed himself.  “No,” he began through a polite mask. “My parents may have had a checkered past.  But I have always acted to serve the best interests of my family’s legacy -- and our people.”  The music began to change, indicating that this song would soon end.  “I may,” he said after a moment, “not seem like an angel.  But I assure you, I am no devil.”  Letting go of her hand and waist, he stepped back as the other male dancers were doing, and bowed to her.  “Enjoy the rest of your evening, Miss deChenzzi,” he said, looking up.  “I hope my presence will not spoil it further.”
	
<p>He stood up fully and made his way past her towards the staircase.  She turned to watch him ascend it, while she stood alone in the middle of the dance floor.  She turned quickly to meet Seela’s gaze from the balcony and gave a slight nod, then left the dance floor and made her way towards a group of donors that she recognized.


<p>***


 	
<p>Andrew and Dia walked arm and arm through the main doors of the gala entrance with other arriving guests after clearing the security check before the door.  Classical music drifted softly through the air as scores of people moved about.  It was difficult to get a clear view of the dance floor due to the lines of onlookers, not to mention the fresh round of entrees and drinks being carried about by the waiting staff.
 	
<p>“Talk about ritzy,” Andrew said as they stopped to take in the scene.
 	
<p>“Enjoy it while you can,” said Dia, glancing at him. “You may never get a chance to attend something like this again.”
 	
<p>They began to make their way through the crowd, each grabbing a drink from a passing waiter.  They had managed to make their way halfway along the right side of the room when someone behind them called Dia’s name.
 	
<p>“Dia?” asked a voice behind them. They both turned to meet a violet-skinned Twi’lek.
 	
<p>“Seela?” Dia responded. 
 	
<p>“Oh my gosh, how are you?!” Seela said.
 	
<p>“What a pleasant surprise to see you,” Dia said.  The two exchanged a quick kiss on each cheek.  “I haven’t seen you since my last visit here as a teenager.”
 	
<p>“It’s been too long,” said Seela with an animated gesture.  “You look absolutely fabulous!  And who,” she said, looking at Andrew, “is this dashing man?”
 	
<p>“Seela, this is my partner in crime, Andrew.  We were part of a unit with the Alliance for a while.”
 	
<p>“A pleasure,” Andrew said, reaching out to shake Seela’s hand.
 	
<p>“You sure know how to pick them, Dia,” Seela said with a wink. “If I didn’t know he was with you, I might just have had to steal him away.”
 	
<p>The two women gave light-hearted laughs.
 	
<p>“Oh believe me,” Dia said with a forced smile, “you really don’t want to do that,” then took a drink from her glass.  
 	
<p>“Do you have a few minutes to catch up?  It’s been too long,” Seela said.
 	
<p>Dia gave a quick glance to Andrew, who nodded.
 	
<p>“I can spare a few minutes,” she said, handing her drink to Andrew. “But first, I need to visit the little girl’s room.  Don’t wander off too far,” she said to Andrew, then pointed a finger at him. “And don’t you dare do any dancing without me!”
 	
<p>As the two walked off, complimenting each other’s dressware, Andrew was left to take in the behaviour of the two women, and the other patrons at large.
 	
<p>“I need to get out more,” he muttered to himself, then took a sip from his glass.  The sweet taste of a sparkling apple drink of some sort washed across his taste buds.  Hearing the music end, he moved closer to an opening in the crowd, and noticed a well-dressed Pantoran gentleman ascending the grand staircase.  In the center of the dance floor was the Contessa he had met previously, who then made her way deftly to a group of patrons on the other side of the room.
 	
<p>“Appetizers, sir?” asked a waitress, stepping next to him with a round tray.  The tray contained a platter of freshly baked scallops wrapped in bacon.  
 	
<p>“Why, thank you,” Andrew said, taking one.  He was about to eat it when she seemed to recognize him. 
 	
<p>“Wait a second … you’re Major Dobson! From the race earlier, right?”
 	
<p>“Uh,” said Andrew, “I am.”
 	
<p>“That was quite the impressive finish.  I’m a huge racing face.  Would you mind if I got a holo pic with you?”
 	
<p>Andrew stood there, baffled momentarily.  He had never been asked for a photo before for his flying.
 	
<p>“Sure,” he said with a shrug, popping the appetizer in his mouth.  “Why not?”
 	
<p>The waitress fished a holo pic device from her pocket and moved in closer to him, handily extending the tray to her left while miraculously maintaining its balance.  She held the device up in front of the two of them.
 	
<p>“Blast and fast!” she said cheerily, smiling.  Before Andrew could say anything, there was a quick flash, and she moved away afterwards.  “Thanks so much!” she said, turning back to him. “I really appreciate it.  Enjoy the evening!”
 	
<p>His eyes re-adjusting to the light, Andrew took another sip from his drink and began to mill about the room with the other patrons.  More were moving towards the dance floor, while others talked and laughed in small groups.  Some stood by themselves, or with a partner.  The odd attendee stopped to briefly speak with him to congratulate him on his race placement, or to thank him for his service to the New Republic.  Others made their way towards tables staffed by serving teams with drinks or appetizers that were different than what was currently being circulated.  He was also able to see the setup for the dining section, the circular tables immaculately decorated with dining cloths, napkins, dishes, silverware, as well as floral arrangements.
 	
<p>“There you are!” Dia said from behind him.  He turned to greet her. “I thought you’d gotten lost.”
 	
<p>“Sorry,” he said. “Just thought I’d mill about for a bit.  Enjoy your catchup chat with Seela?  And where’s your purse?” he asked.
 	
<p>“Yes,” she said enthusiastically.  “And long story short, she’s holding on to it for me while we dance.  She had some last-minute urgent business from her employer come up, but she’ll be back.  The drink’s been … taken care of,” she said sheepishly.
 	
<p>“Uh huh,” Andrew said. “I’m hoping you will pace yourself tonight.”
 	
<p>“Only,” she said, taking his drink from his hand.  She quickly placed it on a tray full of nearly empty glasses that a waiter nearby happened to be carrying. “If you can keep your pace with me.”  She gently but firmly grabbed his hand and tugged him towards the dance floor. “Come on!”
 	
<p>“Woah!” he said, caught by surprise.  The music transitioned to another new song as the dance floor saw the exchange of new and prior dancing couples.  As they entered about a quarter of the way onto the floor, she spun around to face him.  Without missing a beat, he cupped his left hand and placed it behind her on her shoulder blade while she ran her arm up along his and placed it on his shoulder.  They also met their free hands together, slightly out at the side.  It took him a few steps to get the rhythm of the dance down, but once he did he moved in sync with her and the rest of the dancing partners.
 	
<p>“Nice recovery,” she said with a smile as they moved about.
 	
<p>“I try,” he said sheepishly, sliding his feet in time with her.  She gave a small laugh and continued their dance, modifying the steps and patterns as they went.
 	
<p>They danced for several more songs, each presenting a new rhythm or style for them to move to.  Dia was clearly having the time of her life.  After this set of dances, he convinced her that they should find a place to dine that would at least allow them some privacy.  This wasn’t an issue once they tracked down the maitre’d of the event, and Andrew showed them the executive membership card.  Surprisingly enough, they were shown to a table in the corner that afforded some privacy from the bulk of those in attendance.  
 	
<p>“I thought you were reluctant about using that card,” she said as he pulled out her chair for her to sit down.
 	
<p>“I am,” he said, pushing her in gently. “But there’s no money being charged for this event.  And what I’ve come to realize,” he continued as he sat down, “is that sometimes a little influence can go a long way.”
 	
<p>“Indeed, it can,” said the well-dressed Pantoran male as he stepped up to their table. “Major Dobson, isn’t it?” he asked, extending his hand for a handshake.
 	
<p>Andrew stared at him for a moment before extending his hand and grasping the blue-skinned palm in front of him. “I am,” he said.
 	
<p>“Korwin Solari, of Solari Industries.  That was quite a race you had earlier today.  I wanted to congratulate you for your win.  It was quite the show.”
 	
<p>“Thank you, Mister Solari,” Andrew said, breaking the handshake.
 	
<p>“And who, may I ask, is your lovely date for this evening?” Solari said, looking at Dia and extending his hand. Before Andrew could respond, Dia spoke up.
 	
<p>“Dia,” she said with a curt, slow voice. “Dia Tann.”
 	
<p>“Tann, you say,” said Solari, an eyebrow rising slightly on his brow. “Then are you…?”
 	
<p>“I am,” Dia said slowly, with a forced but polite voice.
 	
<p>“Ah.  Well then. I shall not trouble you any further,” he said, letting go of Dia’s hand and standing upright again. “I hope that you both enjoy the rest of your evening.”
 	
<p>With that, he turned and made his way towards his own private table at the other end of the room where two other individuals of high-status met him.
 	
<p>“What was that about?” Andrew asked, looking at her.
 	
<p>“A bit of a long story,” she said as a waiter brought them their drinks and some appetizers. “But let’s just say that I’m not Solari’s biggest fan.”
 	
<p>“How so?”
 	
<p>“Well,” she said, taking a sip of her wine, “in truth Solari has at times used his money for good with respect to philanthropic enterprises and charities.  But he plays hardball with his business ventures.  Has been known to bully his opponents to get his way, or engage in hostile takeovers.  What benefits him seldomly ends well for his business rivals.”
 	
<p>“Would you say he’s two-faced?” Andrew asked, taking a drink of water.
 	
<p>“Not so much two-faced as a cunning snake.  Or a cheshire cat, offering you a toothy smile while readying its claws to pounce.”
 	

<p>***


 	
<p>Suli deChenzzi sat at her immaculately set private table with Seela.  After rubbing elbows with business and political friends and acquaintances, both new and old, she was ready to eat her meal.
 	
<p>As the waitress brought the two of them their drinks, leaving the bottle of wine nearby in a bucket of ice, a second brought them a delectable meal of seafood and grilled vegetables.
 	
<p>“So, Seela,” she asked, cutting into the flaky white meat of the main fish with her knife and fork, “what do you make of the evening thus far?”
 	
<p>Seela stopped taking a drink of her wine and eyed Suli.
 	
<p>“Ma’am?” she asked.
 	
<p>“Oh come now, dear,” Suli said, stopping the movement of her silverware and throwing her a look. “While I seldomly ask you your opinion of matters, that doesn’t mean I don’t value what you have to offer me from time to time.  So I’ll ask again: what do you make of this evening?”
 	
<p>Seela placed her wine glass on the table and folded her hands in her lap.
 	
<p>“Well, ma’am,” she began, “it would seem that the evening is going well.  Everyone is clearly enjoying themselves.  The food and beverages are popular.”
 	
<p>“And?” Suli asked, a coy smile reaching the corners of her mouth.
 	
<p>“And … I may have noticed an attractive bachelor.  Or two,” she finished, taking a sip from her drink once more.  She glanced at her boss, who was clearly enthused and curious about this last comment.
 	
<p>“Have you now?” she asked, working away at her fish once more.  She lifted her fork to gently place a piece in her mouth, chewing away at it. “And will you pursue any of them?”
 	
<p>Seela blushed at this inquiry. 
 	
<p>“Oh, well … I … you see,” she said in a flustered voice.
 	
<p>Suli gave a quiet laugh, clearly amused at herself and the situation.
 	
<p>“Relax, darling,” Suli said. “Just having a little fun.”  She took a sip of wine from her glass, which mixed well with the fish and enhanced its flavour. “Though you would do well to find out more about any potential matches that you eye.”
 	
<p>“Ah, I see,” said Seela. “You’re suggesting I know everything about one’s character before I pursue them further?”
 	
<p>“It would certainly be an advantage, dear.  And once you do, make them work to keep you.”
 	
<p>Seela watched as Suli began to work away at some of the vegetables.
 	
<p>“And how much fun would that be,” she asked, “knowing everything and removing the mystery and fun a potential relationship could hold?”
 	
<p>Suli eyed Seela carefully before responding. 
 	
<p>“A fair comment, dear,” she said carefully. “I suppose a bit of fun from time to time would be in order.”
 	
<p>“Just like you did with Solari?” Seela asked.
 	
<p>This stopped Suli short of taking another drink.
 	
<p>“Why, whatever do you mean?” she asked Seela.
 	
<p>“I watched you both closely as you danced earlier this evening.  You said something to get under his skin.”
 	
<p>“I may have,” she said, taking another sip of her wine, then waved her glass around. “What of it?”
 	
<p>“You clearly know Mister Solari very well.  What did you say to upset him so?”
 	
<p>“Nothing too harsh.  I just gave the odd quip about his demeanour and business dealings.  And his family,” she finished after a moment.
 	
<p>“That quip must have been quite the jab,” Seela said, narrowing her brow. “If I didn’t know any better, I’d say you stung him. Deeply.  You didn’t by chance insult his late parents and sister, did you?”
 	
<p>Suli paused, considering her answer.
 	
<p>“I may have,” she said flatly.
 	
<p>“Suli,” Seela said, giving a sigh and leaning over slightly, arm now resting on the table. “Was that the best choice, especially for this venue?”
 	
<p>“Korwin Solari is a snake and a bully,” Suli said intently. 
 	
<p>“Maybe when it comes to business, yes,” Seela countered, “but he does have a heart.  And he is still a man who generously helps people, regardless of what others think.  Would you think it fine if he insulted your dear husband at a similar venue?”
 	
<p>Suli set her drink down and shifted in her seat to look at Seela for several moments.
 	
<p>“No,” she sighed, clearly understanding Seela’s point. “I wouldn’t.”
 	
<p>Seela nodded, then began to work away at her meal.
 	
<p>“I suppose I should apologize, shouldn’t I?” Suli asked her.
 	
<p>“It would be a kind gesture,” she said, looking at her again, “especially considering the circumstances.”
 	
<p>Suli gave a small, amused laugh. “You’re very cunning, dear.  Have I ever told you that?”
 	
<p>“I learn from the best,” Seela said coyly.
 	
<p>“Very well then. I’ll apologize after our meal, though certainly not before our dessert.  To cunning women,” Suli said, holding up her wine glass.  They clinked theirs together, and enjoyed the rest of their meal.
